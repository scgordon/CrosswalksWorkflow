  <abstract>
    <section>
      <para>Native vegetation is the key resource upon which rangelands are built, and restoring rangeland ecosystems are one of the most critical challenges facing rangeland managers today.  This experimental fire research project, in collaboration with the USFWS and the Sevilleta LTER, is intended to provide FWS and other land managers of southwestern grasslands and rangelands with information about vegetation recovery following fire under different seasonal conditions and burning treatments.  This experimental research will enable the FWS to more effectively set project objectives for prescribed burning on the Sevilleta NWR to benefit not only wildlife habitat, but to better align the timing and intensity of fire to benefit the reestablishment of the dominant native grama grasses Bouteloua eriopoda and B. gracilis.  Since its creation in 1973, management has been devoted to restoring the Sevilleta NWR to the natural conditions that might have been seen around the turn of the century.  The Sevilleta NWR is an ideal place for research because climatic conditions, plant species composition and net primary production following wildfire have been well documented by the Sevilleta LTER. Additional experimental research is needed, however, to better inform managers about the timing and use of fire as an ecosystem restoration and management tool. Data collection and analysis will be continued by the Sevilleta LTER beyond the requested funding period.</para>

    <geographicCoverage>
      <geographicDescription>Location: McKenzie Flats is located within the northeastern section of the Sevilleta NWR, encompassing an area from Black Butte south  to Palo Duro Canyon and east to the Los Pinos.Landform: McKenzie Flats is a broad, nearly flat grassland plain between the Los Pinos Mountains and the breaks on the east side of the Rio Grande., Geology: Deep (20,000 ft) alluvial and aeolian deposits., Soils: Turney Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Calciorthids.  Berino Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids., Hydrology: Surface water only during rain events, no arroyos.  Run-on plain for Los Pinos Mountains., Vegetation: The terrain is generally a mixed-species desert grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), blue grama (B. gracilis), sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola), various drop seeds and sacatons (Sporobolus spp.), purple three-awn (Aristida purpurea), and burrow grass (Scleropogon brevifolia).  Shrubs are common in the area around Five Points, including creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)., Climate: Long-term mean annual precipitation is 243 mm, about 60% of which occurs during the summer.  Long-term mean monthly temperatures for January and July are 1.5 degrees C and 25.1 degrees C, respectively., History: McKenzie Flats encompasses an area of approximately 50 square miles and was one of the primary livestock grazing areas within what is now the Sevilleta NWR.  Cattle have been excluded from the site since 1974-76.  The ranch headquarters buildings and corrals were located at the junction of Legs C and D of the coyote survey.  , siteid: 25</geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Experimental burning treatments and sampling sites are located in a long-term unburned area of Chihuahuan desert grassland dominated by B. eriopoda. &#160;The experimental design is completely randomized, with four treatments replicated five times. Treatments are spring (dormant season), summer (growing season) and fall (dormant season) fires and unburned. Replicates are randomly assigned to 20 .24-ha plots. Ten meters of unburned area separates the plots. &#160;Response variables measured include plant community composition; percent ground cover of live perennial grasses, herbaceous dicots, shrubs, cacti, litter, and bare ground; aboveground net primary production; and several soil parameters (moisture, organic matter content, and field available nitrogen (NO3-N and NH4-N)).This experiment was initiated in June 2007 with one year of pre-treatment and one year of post-treatment data collected thus far. &#160;Prescribed fires were carried out starting in fall 2007 (November) with the spring (March) and summer (June) fires in 2008. &#160;Plant community composition and percent cover of individual plant species will continue to be monitored semiannually (spring and fall) in ten permanently marked 1m2 subplots in each plot (n=200). Aboveground net primary production will be estimated by measuring standing crop in 10 - 0.1m2 subplots in each plot every year at the end of the growing season. &#160;Soil will continue to be collected each year and will be analyzed in the Biology Annex Lab at UNM.</literalLayout>
