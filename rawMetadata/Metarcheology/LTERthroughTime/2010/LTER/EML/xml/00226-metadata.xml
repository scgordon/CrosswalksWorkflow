			<para>A light (PAR) extinction coefficient is calculated for the water column for the seven
				northern study lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, and Trout lakes,
				unnamed lakes 27-02 [Crystal Bog] and 12-15 [Trout Bog]). The fraction of surface light is
				computed at 0.25-m to 1-m depth intervals depending on the lake. The light (PAR) extinction
				coefficient is calculated by regressing ln(fraction of light(z)) on depth z. Sampling
				Frequency: fortnightly during ice-free season - every 6 weeks during ice-covered season
				Number of sites: 7 </para>

						<para>Light (PAR) extinction coefficient is calculated by linearly regressing ln
							(FRLIGHT (z)) on depth z where the intercept is not constrained. FRLIGHT(z) = LIGHT(z)
							or DECK(z) where LIGHT(z) is light measured at depth z and DECK(z) is light measured
							on deck (above water) at the same time. For open water light profiles, the surface
							light measurement (depth z = 0) is excluded from the regression. For winter light
							profiles taken beneath the ice, the first light data are taken at the bottom of the
							ice cover and are included in the regression. The depth of uppermost light value is
							equal to the depth of the ice adjusted by the water level in the sample hole, i.e.,
							the depth below the surface of the water. The water level can be at, above or below
							the surface of the ice. If the water level was not recorded, it is assumed to be 0.0
							and the calculated light extinction coefficient is flagged. If ice thickness was not
							recorded, a light extinction coefficient is not calculated. For light data collected
							prior to March, 2007, light values less than 3.0 (micromolesPerMeterSquaredPerSec) are
							excluded. For light data collected starting in March 2007, light values less than 1.0
							(micromolesPerMeterSquaredPerSec) are excluded. Except for bog lakes before August
							1989, a light extinction coefficient is not calculated if there are less than three
							FRLIGHT values to be regressed. For bog lakes before August 1989, a light extinction
							coefficient is calculated if there are least two FRLIGHT values to be regressed. In
							these cases, the light extinction coefficient is flagged as non-standard. FRLIGHT
							values should be monotonically decreasing with depth. For light profiles where this is
							not true, a light extinction coefficient is not calculated. For samples for which
							light data at depth are present, but the corresponding deck light are missing, a light
							extinction coefficient is calculated by regressing ln (LIGHT (z)) on depth z. Note
							that if actual deck light had remained constant during the recording of the light
							profile, the resulting light extinction coefficient is the same as from regressing
							ln(FRLIGHT(z)). In these cases, the light extinction coefficient is flagged as
							non-standard. </para>

			<abstract>
				<para>North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research studies the ecology of lakes as
					one of a network of sites established by the National Science Foundation. We are
					interested in how biophysical setting, climate, and changing land use and cover interact
					to shape lake characteristics and dynamics over time (past, present, future). Our primary
					study sites include a set of seven northern Wisconsin and four southern Wisconsin lakes
					and their surrounding landscapes. The project, which started in 1981, is administered by
					the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Perception of Long-Term
					Change: How and why have the lake districts changed, and how will they change in the
					future? Climatic Forcing of Change: What are the major ecological and social responses of
					lake districts to climate change? Interacting Drivers, Scales of Space and Time, and
					Regional Change: How do multiple interacting drivers affect regional change in lake
					districts at multiple scales? Ecosystem Services: Past, Present and Future: What are the
					magnitudes, interactions and potential future flows of ecosystem services in lake
					districts? </para>

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Bog is located within the Northern
						Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County. It is a small and shallow bog lake.
						It has a surface area of 0.5 hectare, mostly undeveloped shoreline and a maximum depth
						of 2.5 meters. Bog lakes are isolated to a large extent from surrounding groundwater
						flow systems. However, they exhibit a similar pattern, across landscapes, to that
						exhibited by other lakes in general. The proportional input of groundwater to the bogs'
						hydrologic inputs increases with decreasing elevation in the landscape. More detailed
						studies of Crystal Bog reveal a complex interplay between conditions in the lake and in
						the surrounding wetland due to the groundwater flow regime and resulting chemical
						transfers.</geographicDescription>

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Lake is located within the Northern
						Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County. It is a seepage lake with
						predominantly sand substrate. It has a surface area of 36.7 hectare, 2.3 kilometers of
						mostly undeveloped (campground) developed shoreline and a maximum depth of 20.4 meters.
						Crystal Lake represents one extreme in the groundwater input gradient, with a marked
						predominance of precipitation inputs. Groundwater accounts for only 5% of input water,
						yet, because groundwater is more concentrated chemically than precipitation, groundwater
						accounts for substantial amounts of incoming solutes. For example, about 50% of the
						silica budget comes into the lake via groundwater, exerting a major influence on primary
						production. The lake is an oligotrophic, dimictic lake high in the landscape with
						minimal groundwater input, a light attenuation coefficient of 0.24 per meter (average
						ice-free Secchi depth of 8 m), a mean depth of 11.4 m, and a maximum depth of 20.4 m.
						Crystal Lake is circular with a shoreline development factor very close to 1.0. The
						littoral zone is fairly homogenous and is dominated by sandy substrate with low
						macrophyte and coarse woody habitat densities. The fish community has been historically
						dominated by pelagic yellow perch. However, yellow perch drastically declined after the
						detection of rainbow smelt in 1985.</geographicDescription>
