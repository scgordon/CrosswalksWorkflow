		<abstract>
			<para>Wisconsin has lost approximately 2 million hectares of wetland since statehood (1848).
				Through the combined efforts of state and federal agencies and private groups focused
				primarily on wetland restoration for waterfowl habitat management or compensatory
				mitigation, a fairly substantial gain in wetland area has been achieved. Much of the wetland
				restoration effort in Wisconsin has occurred on formerly agricultural lands. However, due to
				the nature of the past disturbance and possible residual effects not corrected by simply
				returning surface waters to these lands, there is some question regarding the resultant
				wetland quality or biological integrity. In an effort aimed at developing tools to measure
				wetland gains in terms of quality or ecological integrity, the Wisconsin Department of
				Natural Resources (WDNR) initiated a study of biological communities on restored wetlands in
				Wisconsin. We report on the community of microcrustaceans and arthropods that can be
				collected with a plankton net in open water in wetlands. We examined zooplankton community
				structure in restored wetlands in terms of richness, taxonomic representation, and Daphnia
				sexual reproduction and related these metrics to attributes on wetlands representing
				least-disturbed conditions and agriculturally impacted wetlands. We sampled 56 palustrine
				wetlands distributed across Wisconsin. These wetland sites were categorized as agricultural,
				least-impacted, and restored (recently withdrawn from agricultural usage). The wetlands were
				reasonably homogeneous in many ways, so that taxon richness was not correlated with basin
				origin, presence of adjacent roads, presence or absence of fish, water chemistry, or the
				size of the open water. We identified a total of 40 taxa.. We conclude that restoration of
				wetland watersheds works. Withdrawal of the watershed from agricultural usage is followed by
				an increase in taxon richness, and the sites resembled least-impacted sites in about 6-7
				years. Dodson, S. I. and R. A. Lillie. 2001. Zooplankton communities of restored

						<para>Field Sampling WDNR personnel collected zooplankton and water chemistry samples
							from each wetland during early spring (mid-April to early May) prior to desiccation.
							We classified each wetland according to its origin, setting, and type of current
							disturbance and subjectively estimated the percent land-use cover (row crops, pasture,
							urban, wooded, grassland, etc.) in the surface watershed of each wetland. We
							interviewed wildlife managers to determine the age of restored wetlands. We used a
							polar planimeter (maps scales varied among wetlands) to measure the surface area of
							each wetland. We recorded maximum water depth to the nearest cm with a meter stick
							during visits to each wetland in April&#226;&#128;&#147;May. The Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene (WSLH)
							has established standard operating procedures (SOPs) for field collection,
							preservation, handling, and laboratory analysis that the WDNR must adhere to. The
							surface water chemistry analysis is referred to by the WSLH as non-compliance sampling
							(i.e., data not used for legal purposes) but which still must meet all regulatory
							holding times (be processed within a given number of days) or if times are exceeded,
							the analyses are not run (time limits for regulatory purposes are given in APHA
							(1989). Preservation for the automated alkalinity-pH-conductivity analysis calls for
							cooling to 4 degree C en route, refrigeration, and analysis within 14 days of
							collection (WSLH 1997). We collected water samples for pH, alkalinity, and
							conductivity measurements from a central basin location (undisturbed) within each
							wetland using a 250-ml plastic jar provided by the WSLH. Samples were placed in an
							iced cooler until delivered to the WSLH in Madison within one week of collection.
							Water duration was defined as the number of months of standing water during the
							growing season (March&#226;&#128;&#147;November). Duration determinations were made using longterm
							records, personal observations, or in a few cases, estimates based on the depth of
							water remaining in the basin in July. The presence of fish was noted when fish were
							captured or observed during sampling. However, there was no systematic sampling of
							zooplankton predators. We collected zooplankton samples from an undisturbed, central
							basin location within each wetland using a graduated 4-L grab bucket. The contents of
							the bucket were mixed and carefully filtered through a 200-micron-mesh net until the
							mesh began to clog or until a substantial quantity of zooplankton was visible in the
							net. Sample volume varied between 1 and 16 liters, depending of how fast the filter
							clogged. The quantity of sample filtered was recorded on a field sheet, and the sample
							was preserved in 95percent Ethanol. Laboratory Methods Water chemistry analyses were
							completed under contract with the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene using a
							standard protocol (WSLH 1997). Duplicative qualitative control limits for alkalinity
							are 1.08 percent less than 250 and 0.95 percent greater than 250. For conductivity,
							they are 1.69 percent less than 100 and 1.24 percent greater than 100. Each
							zooplankton sample was scrutinized to identify taxa of microcrustaceans and planktonic
							insects. Rotifers were not identified. When Daphnia occurred, they were all counted
							and scored according to gender. Taxa were identified at various levels according to
							procedures described by Schell et al. (2001). </para>

			<abstract>
				<para>North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research studies the ecology of lakes as
					one of a network of sites established by the National Science Foundation. We are
					interested in how biophysical setting, climate, and changing land use and cover interact
					to shape lake characteristics and dynamics over time (past, present, future). Our primary
					study sites include a set of seven northern Wisconsin and four southern Wisconsin lakes
					and their surrounding landscapes. The project, which started in 1981, is administered by
					the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Perception of Long-Term
					Change: How and why have the lake districts changed, and how will they change in the
					future? Climatic Forcing of Change: What are the major ecological and social responses of
					lake districts to climate change? Interacting Drivers, Scales of Space and Time, and
					Regional Change: How do multiple interacting drivers affect regional change in lake
					districts at multiple scales? Ecosystem Services: Past, Present and Future: What are the
					magnitudes, interactions and potential future flows of ecosystem services in lake
					districts? </para>
