<abstract>
   <section>
    <para>Using automated overwinter sampling devices, preserved phytoplankton samples
      were collected from multiple depths in Lake Fryxell, a permanently ice-covered lake in
      southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. Photosynthetic algae (i.e. algae possessing chloroplasts)
      are maintained in a stable water column throughout winter darkness. The algal taxa
      "overwinter" in different ways, in a species specific manner. Typical vegetative cells were
      the most abundant form for all species found in the water column. Populations of one
      chlorophyte, Stichococcus sp., and two cryptophyte species increased during winter. We
      interpret the increase in algal population size as evidence of wintertime heterotrophic
      growth, and mixotrophic behavior in the context of the entire year. For two chlorophyte
      species some portion of the population had distinct morphology, e.g. akinetes for
      Chlamydomonas subcaudata and cells containing a large amount of starch or other storage
      material for Chlorella sp.. During winter, vegetative cells of the most abundant species of
      cyanobacteria, Phormidium angustissimum, occurred at the depth of the summertime maximum and
      at depths below the oxycline, which may represent a "false bottom". Other than this false
      bottom and the absence of diatoms, settling did not appear to influence the overwintering
      algal community.</para>

   <geographicCoverage>
    <geographicDescription> Lake Fryxell is located in Taylor Valley in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of
     southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The McMurdo Dry Valleys is the largest of the desert oases
     on the Antarctic coast and is located in the Transantarctic Mountains along the western edge of
     McMurdo Sound. The valleys run perpendicular to the coast and contain numerous perennially
     ice-covered lakes.
     
     Lake Fryxell is fed by nine major inflow streams which drain Canada and
     Commonwealth Glaciers and glaciers in the Kukri Hills. The streams are neutral pH and range in
     conductivity from 23 uS to 200 uS, with solutes accrued by dissolution of marine aerosols,
     calcite and primary weathering of silicate rocks. Nutrients are gained through weathering of
     apatite and dissolution of nitrate from atmospheric deposition. Lower nutrient concentrations
     occur in streams with abundant algal mats. Streamwater DOC concentrations are as high as 9 mg
     C/L during the initial flow and then decrease to 1 mg C/L or less. Fulvic acid accounts for
     only 7-10% of streamwater DOC, suggesting that streamflow may contribute labile organic
     substrates to the lake.
     
     The annual cycle of dry valley ecosystems is controlled by extreme
     changes between summer and winter. During summer, beginning at the end of October, there is
     continuous sunlight and temperatures above freezing occur for periods of several days. These
     summer conditions support growth of photosynthetic algae in the pelagic zone and benthos of the
     lake, and in many meltwater streams. The winter period of total darkness begins in mid-April
     and ends in mid-August. The ice-cover protects the lake ecosystem from the extreme winds and
     cold temperatures of winter. Stream algal mats survive winter in a dormant "freeze-dried"
     state. In the "spring" (mid-August to late October) and "fall" (mid-February to mid-April) the
     valleys are in twilight during portions of the day, and air temperatures are warmer than in
     winter, but always below freezing. 
     
     In Lake Fryxell, streamflow mixes with a 1-2 m layer just
     below the ice-cover. Below this layer, the water column is very stable and chemical profiles
     are consistent with molecular diffusion. The major ions and DOC increase with depth. Bottom
     waters at 18 m have a salinity of 25% of seawater and a DOC concentration of 30 mg C/L. The DOC
     profile and high DOC concentration in sediment is a significant DOC source. Fulvic acid
     accounts for 20-24% of the DOC and the fulvic acid chemistry is uniform except for higher
     sulfur content at depth. 
     
     Photosynthesis by phytoplankton begins in September and continues into
     fall. During summer, about 1% of the surface light penetrates the ice cover and light intensity
     decreases exponentially to values about 0.3uM/m^2/s at 9 m. In this euphotic zone, O2
     concentrations are supersaturated due to freeze out of O2 carried by streamwater and to algal
     production of O2. A sharp oxycline occurs at about 9.5 m, and below the oxycline H2S
     concentrations increase with depth.</geographicDescription>

     <para>
      <literalLayout> Samples were obtained and preserved in situ through the winter season using
       automated time series samplers. The samplers were composed of an array of syringes suspended
       at a series of depths on an in situ mooring. Each syringe was hydraulically connected to a
       manifold and linked to a gear pump. A floating piston in each syringe was hydraulically
       driven to draw water at prescribed time intervals and introduce Lugol's solution (KI, I and
       acetic acid) as a preservative.
       
       Algae were identified and enumerated with the use of a Nikon
       Diaphot inverted microscope under oil immersion at 1000x magnification. Subsamples were
       allowed to settle in chambers following the method of Utermohl. Strip counts were made with a
       minimum of 100 individuals of the most common taxa enumerated. Identifications were based
       primarily upon keys by Prescott, Tikkanen, and Seaburg et al. Cells with intact chloroplasts
       were counted as "live". Visibly-degraded cells were not counted. We noted qualitatively that
       few visibly degraded cells were found in the winter samples, which is comparable to the
       summer samples. Subsamples were also examined at 100x to enumerate protozoans. 
       
       In order to  evaluate changes in cell volume between winter and summer, cell volumes were determined by
       measuring cell dimensions and approximating cell shape to geometric shape. Dimensions of 10
       cells of each taxa were measured in four samples from different depths collected in April
       1990. In a previous study, 100 cells of each taxa were measured to determine variance in
       size.</literalLayout>
