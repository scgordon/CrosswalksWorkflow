Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration, moisture content, and salinity analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Samples were taken from within the 10 cm diameter circular area of each plot. The location of the sampling was recorded so that areas were not re-sampled. Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to 10 cm depth. Very large rocks (&gt;20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at 4C until further processing.  In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening.

Subsamples of soil were taken for EC analysis. 150ml of deionized water was added to 25g of soil in a clean, DI- rinsed glass 150-ml tall form beaker (coarse fragments &gt;3-4 mm were removed). The samples were stirred until thoroughly mixed (about 20 sec). After sitting for 10 seconds, the samples were stirred again and an initial reading was taken with a YSI 30 conductivity meter. Regarding EC units on the datasheet, the meter took readings at micromhos. The numbers were converted to dS/m (deciSeimens/meter) by dividing by 1000.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>Units_and_Column_Descriptions</entityName><physical scope="document"><objectName>Units_and_Column_Descriptions</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><numFooterLines>0</numFooterLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter><quoteCharacter>"</quoteCharacter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://www.mcmlter.org/data/soils/short-term/seec.dat</url></online></distribution></physical><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>LOCATION</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Name of area where measurement was made</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Name of area where measurement was made</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>DATE</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Date on which sample was gathered</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Date" /><measurementScale><dateTime><formatString>mm/dd/yy</formatString></dateTime></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>SAMPLE#</attributeName><attributeDefinition>ID associated with transect, sampling location</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>ID associated with transect, sampling location</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Electrical Conductivity</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Number" /><measurementScale><ratio><unit><customUnit>dS/m</customUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>null</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>COMMENTS</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Helpful hints about the sample</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Helpful hints about the sample</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>FILE NAME</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Name of file in which data was stored</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Name of file in which data was stored</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList></dataTable></dataset><additionalMetadata><metadata><unitList><unit id="dS/m" /></unitList></metadata></additionalMetadata></ns0:eml>
