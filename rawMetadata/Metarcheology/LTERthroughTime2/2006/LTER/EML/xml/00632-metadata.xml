The file format was suggested by the LTER data manager, to conform with the relational database structure. On 19 Oct 1998, the file was submitted to Denise Steigerwald, the MCM LTER data manager, located at INSTAAR, University of Colorado.
							
							Upon arrival at INSTAAR, the data manager combined the 3 data files, removed columns for latitude and longitude, and updated the location names to match those provided in the "soil measurement locations" file (from which latitude and longitude can be found). In addition, a column for depth range was added in order to make it possible to compare soil moisture, chlorophyll-a, and soil nematode densities found at a given depth, but stored in different data files (dpca94, dpah94, dpso9394, and dpwo9394 files). The resulting file was reformatted to present in ascii, comma delimited text and MS-DOS text (table layout) on the MCM LTER web site. Both of these files are linked to this web page above.
							
							On 28-Oct-1998, Andy Parsons discovered an error in the documentation of the storage temperature used for the soil samples collected. He informed the data manager of this error, resulting in an update from -8C to +5C in the methods portion of the page above.</literalLayout></para></section></description></maintenance><contact scope="document"><organizationName>McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Mexico</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>MSC03 2020</deliveryPoint><city>Albuquerque</city><administrativeArea>NM</administrativeArea><postalCode>87131</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">505-277-3418</phone><phone phonetype="fax">505-277-0304</phone><electronicMailAddress>mcmdata@lternet.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Mexico</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>MSC03 2020</deliveryPoint><city>Albuquerque</city><administrativeArea>NM</administrativeArea><postalCode>87131</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">505-277-3418</phone><phone phonetype="fax">505-277-0304</phone><electronicMailAddress>mcmdata@lternet.edu</electronicMailAddress></publisher><methods><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and
							moisture content analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with
							one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Centers
							of 8 polygons were found and labelled "A" to "H". Samples were taken
							from within a 10 cm diameter circular area of each plot. The location of
							the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not re-sampled. A
							hole approximately 20 cm deep was dug at the center of each polygon.
							Samples were taken at depths 0-2.5 cm, 2.5-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-20 cm by
							digging in from the sides. Very large rocks (&gt;20 mm diameter)
							were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak'
							bag. The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed
							tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored
							in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8
							hours of sampling), the soils were stored at +5 degrees C until further
							processing. 
							
							In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar
							flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed
							thoroughly prior to opening. Approximately 200cm3 of soil was placed in
							a pre-weighed 800mL plastic beaker. Rocks greater than 3-4mm in diameter
							were removed from the sample. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was
							removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum dish, and weighed on a
							balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105 degrees C for 24
							hours. The sample was removed, placed in desiccator to cool down, and
							re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil
							and to express data as numbers of soil organisms per unit dry weight of
							soil.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>Units_and_Column_Descriptions</entityName><physical scope="document"><objectName>Units_and_Column_Descriptions</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><numFooterLines>0</numFooterLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter><quoteCharacter>"</quoteCharacter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://www.mcmlter.org/data/soils/short-term/dpso9394.dat</url></online></distribution></physical><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>LOCATION</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Name of area where measurement was made</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Name of area where measurement was made</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>DATE</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Date on which sample was gathered</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Date" /><measurementScale><dateTime><formatString>mm/dd/yy</formatString></dateTime></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Depth range (cm)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Minimum and maximum soil depth from which sample was drawn</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Number" /><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>centimeter</standardUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType><bounds><minimum exclusive="false">0</minimum><maximum exclusive="false">20</maximum></bounds></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required Entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>SAMPLE#</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Sample ID associated with sampling location</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Sample ID associated with sampling location</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>SOIL WATER CONTENT (%)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Percent water found in soil</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Number" /><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>dimensionless</standardUnit></unit><precision>0.0001</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType><bounds><minimum exclusive="false">0</minimum><maximum exclusive="false">100</maximum></bounds></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>null</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>COMMENTS</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Helpful hints about the sample</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Helpful hints about the sample</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>FILE NAME</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Name of file in which data was stored</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Name of file in which data was stored</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList></dataTable></dataset></ns0:eml>
