      The 'discrete_stream_gauge' table was created by Harry House in early 1994. It
       was first stored in an INGRES database, but was converted to ORACLE format in early 1996.
       Modifications were generally made each year after the initial creation in the early part of
       the year. It was transferred to INSTAAR in late 1997, where it was stored in a Microsoft
       Access database, and presented on the web in ascii, comma delimited files. 
       </para><para>
       In October, 1999 Mike Gooseff submitted the 1997-98 data to Denise Steigerwald (the data manager) in ascii,
       comma delimited files. In order to prepare the files for use in an Oracle database as well as
       a geographic information system, Denise created a field for "strmgageid" (stream gage id),
       converted any time fields of 24:00 to 0:00 on the following day, combined the date and time
       fields into one date/time field, and separated the data into separate files for each station.
       Data which was previously presented according to decade collected is now presented according
       to location, and contains records from the start date of monitoring for a given stream gage.
       The resulting files are available through the links provided above.
      </para><para>
       In order to make the data more relational / useful in Oracle and ArcInfo, and generate links between
       different data and metadata fields, a dataset code was added to these files.
      </para>
      
<para>
    New codes for the COMMENTS column were created in 2005 after a meeting between the stream
       team and the information manager (Chris Gardner).  These comments were added to stream data that were worked up
       after that point  - they usually appear in the data around the 2003 season.
     </para>
     
     <para>
      2002-3 through 2004-5 Brownworth and Vanda records: processing/ reprocessing records The 2001-2 season was the highest flow year on record. Based on measured data and on data estimated as discussed in this section, the total seasonal flow was about twice as high as any observed during the previous ten years and in most cases was at least eight times greater. Such high flows usually lead to changes in channel morphology and would likely require the development of new rating curves for the gages.
      </para><para>
       However, both the 2002-3 and the 2003-4 Onyx River records were processed using rating curves that were in place before the 2001-2 season. This was because there were not yet enough post-2001-2 season flow measurements done to make a new rating curve. During the 2005-6 season, more intensive flow measurements were done and new rating curves were developed. We decided that it would be more accurate to reprocess the 2002-3 and 2003-4 records with the new rating curves and to use the resulting data than to use the data processed with the older rating curves. In addition, the 2004-5 gage data had not yet been worked up. So, we also processed the 2004-5 data with the newer rating curves. These rating curves were developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Wyoming Science Center (USGS-WY). USGS-WY hydrologists were responsible for processing the records for the 2005-6 season. The rating curves developed by the USGS-WY incorporated stage/discharge measurements from the 2002-3 through 2006-7 seasons. They are drawn as a best fit line through the various stage/discharge points as opposed to going through each point individually. To process/reprocess the 2002-3 through 2005-6 Onyx River records, we employed the methodology implemented by the USGS-WY for working up the records. This involved using the simultaneous stage and flow measurements made during the season under consideration to develop corrections to the raw stage data so that when the rating curve was applied to the corrected stage data, the discharge values associated with times when a flow measurement was made matched the measured flow values. These corrections are needed because, as noted above, the rating curve is a best fit line. The stage/discharge measurements for each season reflect the conditions of that season, for instance, the impacts of freezing and thawing on the elevation of the stage sensors. Thus, the corrections for a season are specific to it. The stage/discharge measurements done at discrete times during the season were considered to be representative of how stream channel conditions were changing throughout the season. Corrections were thus made to change throughout the season and applied to the entire raw data record not just the specific data logged at the time the flow measurements were made.
       </para><para>
       After the corrections were applied to the raw stage data, the rating curve was then used to convert the stage values to discharges. As a final step, described in more detail in the previous section, we compared discharge values to water temperature, specific conductance, and/or air temperature data to ascertain whether any unusually high discharge values might be attributable to sensor freezing effects as opposed to real flow. If this appeared to be the case, we removed those values from the record, leaving them as missing data, which were treated as described in subsequent sections. The method of working up the 2002-3 through 2004-5 Onyx River records was in some ways the inverse of the method used to incorporate additional data into already-processed streamflow records. In the first case, we corrected the raw stage data and then made use of the official rating curve for the gage. In the latter case, we did not alter the additional raw stage data but instead made use of an effective rating curve that had the corrections made by previous hydrologists incorporated in it and that was specific to the particular season under consideration. One final remark about the 2003-4 Brownworth record is that our examination of the notes recorded by hydrologists visiting the Brownworth gage showed that a date error had been made when resetting the data logger. While reprocessing the 2003-4 data, we corrected the date/time stamp associated with the logged data. One final remark about the 2004-5 Brownworth record is that, for this season and gage, we needed to extend the rating curve. The 2005-6 rating only went up to stage values of 2.30 feet, and the 2004-5 Brownworth record had some corrected stage values that went up to about 2.50 feet. We used a third-order polynomial trend line to accomplish this. The r-squared value for the trend line was 0.999.
     </para>

      Chirs Jaros revised in 2014 all data since 2005, as many problems were detected.

Stream flow data was treated with the Aquarius software.  The USGS had previously only worked up telemetered stage data.  Chris Jaros worked up our LTER data (for stage, WT, and SC).  With this correct backbone of data was Chris was able to address  changes (1 - 3) above.

     <para>
       Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, 
       and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure
       transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars 
       from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice 
       lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites 
       monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or
       Campbell temperature/conductivity probes.
</para><para>       
       Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring 
       streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. 
       Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the 
       orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and
       conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while 
       simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes.
       </para><para>
       Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the 
       data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is 
       loaded into ADAPS, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing 
       water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made.
         </para><para>
       For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based
       on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining 
       good data inside of ADAPS. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. 
       Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is 
       assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database.
         </para><para>
       For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations and
       datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered
       into ADAPS. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into ADAPS. All corrections 
       and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. 
       The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. A quality code is assigned 
       to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into ORACLE and the McMurdo database.
