of soil organisms (nematodes, rotifers and tardigrades), divided by species, sex and maturity was
monitored at sampling sites throughout the region in order to accomplish this.
    
The study began in the austral summer of 1993/1994. Samples were taken on:

The file format was suggested by the LTER data manager, to conform with the relational database structure. On 30-Oct-1998, the file was submitted to Denise Steigerwald, the MCM LTER data manager, located at INSTAAR, University of Colorado.
                        
                        Upon arrival at INSTAAR, the data manager combined the 4 data files, removed columns for latitude and longitude, and updated the location names to match those provided in the "soil measurement locations" file (from which latitude and longitude can be found). The resulting file was reformatted to present in ascii, comma delimited text and MS-DOS text (table layout) on the MCM LTER web site. Both of these files are linked to this web page above.
                        
                        On 28-Oct-1998, Andy Parsons discovered an error in the documentation of the storage temperature used for the soil samples collected. He informed the data manager of this error, resulting in an update from -8C to +5C in the methods portion of the page above.
                        
                        On 10-Nov-1998 Denise Steigerwald discovered a typo in the date shown for Cape Royds records represented in the 9312gswo file. Information colleced on 31-Dec-1993 showed a date of 31-Dec-1994. Denise revised these records in the Access database as well as the comma delimited text and MS-DOS text files on the web.</literalLayout></para></section></description></maintenance><contact scope="document"><organizationName>McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Mexico</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>MSC03 2020</deliveryPoint><city>Albuquerque</city><administrativeArea>NM</administrativeArea><postalCode>87131</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">505-277-3418</phone><phone phonetype="fax">505-277-0304</phone><electronicMailAddress>mcmdata@lternet.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Mexico</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>MSC03 2020</deliveryPoint><city>Albuquerque</city><administrativeArea>NM</administrativeArea><postalCode>87131</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">505-277-3418</phone><phone phonetype="fax">505-277-0304</phone><electronicMailAddress>mcmdata@lternet.edu</electronicMailAddress></publisher><methods><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>At each site 5-25 soil samples were taken for organism
enumeration and moisture content analysis as follows:  Sampling bags were
prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample.
The location of the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not
re-sampled.  Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to a 10 cm depth.  Very
large rocks (&gt;20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample.  The soil was
shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil).
The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling
as much air as possible.  The soil samples were stored in a cooler for
transportation.  On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the
soils were stored at +5 degrees C until further processing.


In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent
contamination.  The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to
opening.  Approximately 200cm3 of soil was placed in a pre-weighed 800mL plastic
beaker.  Rocks greater than 3-4mm in diameter were removed from the sample.  A
sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum
dish, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g.  This sample was dried at 105 degrees C
for 24 hours.  The sample was removed, placed in a desiccator to cool down, and
re-weighed.  These data were used to calculate water content of the soil and to
express data as numbers of soil organisms per unit dry weight of soil.  

The remaining soil in the plastic beaker was weighed.  Cold tap water was added
up to 650 mL.  The soil suspension was stirred carefully (star stir or figure of
8) for 30 seconds, using a spatula.  Immediately the liquid was poured into wet
screens - a stack of 40 mesh on top of a 400 mesh.  The screens were rinsed
gently with ice cold tap water (from a wash bottle) through the top of the
stack, keeping the screens at an angle as the water filtered through.  The water
was kept on ice at all times.  The top screen was removed, and the lower screen
rinsed top down, never directly on top of the soil, but at the top of the screen
and from behind.  The water was allowed to cascade down and carry the particles
into the bottom wedge of the angled screen.  The side of the screen was tapped
gently to filter all the water through.  The suspension was rinsed from the
front and the back, keeping the screen at an angle and not allowing the water to
overflow the edge of the screen.  The soil particles were backwashed into a 50mL
plastic centrifuge tube, tipping the screen into the funnel above the tube and
rinsing the funnel gently.  The suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at
1744 RPM.  The liquid was decanted, leaving a few mL on top of the soil particles.  
The tube was filled with sucrose solution (454g sucrose per liter of tap
water, kept refrigerated) up to 45mL.  This was stirred gently with a spatula
until the pellet was broken up and suspended.  The suspension was centrifuged
for one minute at 1744 RPM, decanted into a wet 500 mesh screen, rinsed well
with ice cold tap water and backwashed into a centrifuge tube.  Samples were
refrigerated at 5 degrees C until counted.


Samples were washed into a counting dish and examined under a microscope at x10
or x20 magnification.  Rotifers and tardigrades were identified and counted.
Nematodes were identified to species and sex, and counted.  Total numbers in
each sample were recorded on data sheets.  All species of nematode, and all
rotifers and tardigrades found in the sample were recorded.  Data were entered
into Excel files, printed, and checked for errors.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><dataTable
