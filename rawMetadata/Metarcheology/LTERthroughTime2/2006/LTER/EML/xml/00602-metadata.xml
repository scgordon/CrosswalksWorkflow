     daily nutrient cycling within the North Inlet Estuary System.
     The original sampling site was at Town Creek.  Later samples were
     taken at Clambank and Oyster Landing as well. Samples were taken 365 
     days a year at the same time every day, approximately 10:00 AM EST.  
     The samples were filtered at the Lab to separate the particulates from 
     the water.  The filtered water was then run through a colorimeter and 
     the nutrient value peak heights derived were recorded on a ticker tape 
     type printout.  These values were recorded into a master nutrient note 
     book, and entered onto a CMS file by the Data Management Department at 
     the lab.  The filters that were used in the filtering process were first
     weighted, burnt off and cleaned, then they were weighted with the
     particulates dried onto them.  These filters were then cooked again for 
     24 hours at 450 degrees.  This was done to determine the inorganic
     particulates that were left.  All data files have since been stored
     on a SUN workstation and backed up on 8mm tapes at both the field lab
     and the data management office at the University of South Carolina.

     Analysis methods for the individual variables are described below:

     Ortho-Phosphate

     The basic method was the Technicon Industrial Method No. 155-71W (1973),
     which was a modification of the Murphy and Riley (1962) single solution
     method.  The method depended on the formation of a phospomolybdate blue
     complex, the color of which is read at a wavelength of 880 mm.

     Sulfate

     For this automated procedure for sulfate (Technicon Industrial Method
     No. 118-71W/B), the sample was first passed through a cation-exchange
     column to remove interferences.  The sample containing sulfate was then
     reacted with barium chloride at a pH of 2.5-3.0 to form barium sulfate.
     Excess barium reacted with methylthmol blue to form a blue-colored 
 was gray; if it was all chelated with barium, the color was blue.
     Initially, the barium chloride and methylthymol blue were equimolar and
     equivalent to the highest concentration of sulfate ion expected; thus
     the amount of uncomplexed methylthymol blue, measured at 460 mm, was equal
     to the sulfate present.

     Nitrate/Nitrite
 
     The basic method was Technicon Industrial Method No. 158-71W/B, which
     utilized the reaction in which nitrate was reduced to nitrite by a copper-
     cadmium reductor column.   The nitrite ion then reacted with 
     sulfanilamide under acidic conditions to form a diazo compound.  This 
     compound then coupled with N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride
     to form a reddish-purple azo dye.

     Chlorides

     The basic method was Technicon Industrial Method No. 99-70W/B.  This 
     automated procedure for the determination of chloride depended upon the
     the liberation of thiocyanate ion from mercuric thiocyanate by the 
     formation of unionized but soluble mercuric chloride.  In the presence
     of ferric ion, the liberated thiocyanate formed a highly colored ferric
     thiocyanate proportional to the original chloride concentration.

     Ammonia

     This method was from "The Automated Analysis of Nutrients in Seawater:  A
     Manual of Techniques" by Gilbert and Loder (1977), a Woods Hole 
     Oceanographic Institution publication No. WHO-77-47.  This method was
     dependent upon the Berthelot Reaction, during which the formation of a
     blue colored compound closely related to indophenol occurred when the 
     solution of an ammonium salt was added to sodium phenoxide, followed
     by the addition of sodium hypochlorite.  A solution of potassium sodium
     tartrate and sodium citrate was added to the sample stream to eliminate
     the precipitation of the hydroxides of calcium and magnesium.

     Total Nitrogen -Total PhosphorusThe procedure consisted of an alkaline persulfate oxidation followed by
     automated analysis for nitrogen (as nitrate) and phosphorus (as phosphate)
     on a Technicon Auto Analyzer.

     With alkaline persulfate digestion, all nitrogen in the sample was 
     oxidized to nitrate, which was then reduced by cadmium and analyzed as
     nitrite.  The precision and recovery of this method compared favorably
     with a Kjeldahl procedure (D'Elia et al., 1977).  The main advantage of
     the persulfate oxidation was the speed and convenience with which it was
     accomplished.  Unlike the Kjeldahl method, which recovered only organic
     and NH4 - nitrogen, the persulfate oxidation also included NO3 and
     NO2 nitrogen.

     The procedure described by D'Elia (1977) has been so the digest could be
     analyzed using an autoanalyzer (Gilbert et al., 1977).  This semi-
     automated procedure combined the persulfate oxidation with automated
     nitrate and phosphate analysis to provide simultaneous analysis for total
     persulfate nitrogen (TPN) and total persulfate phosphorus (TPP).  
     Gilbert's procedure was further modified to use a smaller sample size so
     that the digestion flask could double as the sampler tray cup (Loder,
     1978).  Using this method, many samples could be run quickly with a 
     minimum of handling.

     Carbon (prior to September 1989)

     Particulate Carbon

     20 ml of daily water sample was filtered through a precombusted (24 hr @
     450 C) Whatman GFF 0.7 micron glass filter.  The filter was waved over
     concentrated HCl to eliminate inorganic carbon, then placed in a 
     precombusted ampule and frozen.  Batches were dried at 60 C for 48 hrs.
     0.1 gr of precombusted (48 hr @ 750 C) reagent grade CuO was added to 
     each ampule, the ampule was then purged with pure oxygen and sealed,
     using an Oceanigraphics International Purging and Sealing Unit #524PS.
     Ampules were etched, then heated to 580 C for 4 hrs.  Sorted ampules were
     then analyzed on an Oceanigraphics International #524C TOC Analyzer by
     comparing infrared absorption peak heights (Horiba PIR 2000) on an LDC
     strip chart recorder with those of KHP (Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate)
     standards.  Standards were prepared by microsyringing a series of volumes
     of a KHP solution into ampules and processing them as samples.  Reagent 
     blanks were subtracted and average concentration of duplicate samples
     was calculated for each DWS site.

     Dissolved Organic Carbon 

     The daily water sample was filtered through a precombusted (24 hr @ 450 C)
     Whatman GFF 0.7 micron glass filter.  An aliquot of filtrate was 
     refrigerated.  Samples were purged of inorganic carbon by adding 25percent 
     phosphoric acid to lower the pH to 2 and bubbling for 10 minutes with
     pure oxygen.  The pH was then neutralized using ammonium hydroxide to 
     protect the oxidizing catalyst.  Every 5 minutes, using a Hamilton 
     CR-700-200 spring loaded syringe, a 100 microliter sample was injected
     into a Beckman 915A TOC Analyzer and infrared absorption peak heights
     were compared to those of KHP standard solutions to calculate carbon
     concentration.

     Carbon (after September 1989)

     Dissolved Organic Carbon

     Water samples were filtered through a precombusted Whatman GFF 7.0 micron
     glass filter.  Samples were purged of inorganic carbon by adding 10
     percent HCl and sparged with ultra zero grade air.  A 40 microliter 
     aliquot was injected, via a autosampler, into a Shimadzu TOC-500
     organic carbon analyzer.  A non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer was
     utilized to measure the carbon dioxide produced and samples were run in
     triplicate with means reported.

     ***NOTE***  A Whatman GFF 7.0 micron glass fiber filter was used 
     throughout the LTER Daily Water Sample analysis.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Experimental Design</title><para><literalLayout>Water
