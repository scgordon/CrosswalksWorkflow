    <section>
      <para>The long-term goal of the decomposition study was to document the effects of climate variation on decomposition of major plant litter-types. The project began in 1989 and underwent changes of locations and litter types. The long-term litter types included black grama, Indian rice grass, juniper, and creosote. &#160;Mass loss of the litter types can be compared to precipitation and other meteorological factors obtained at nearby locations.</para>

The initial study was designed by Dr. J. Gosz and Dr. R. Parmenter with C.S. White the project manager. The basic design included placement of three (3) primary litter-types (black grama (Bouteloua gracilis), juniper (Juniperus monosperma), and Indian &#160; &#160; &#160; rice grass (Oryzopsis hymenoides)) at seven (7) locations. The seven locations included: along an approximate north-south transect from grass habitat to creosote habitat, Location 1 = Black Butte; Location 2 = Deep Well; Location 3 = 1 mi. east of 5 points (central point along the transect representing a grass-juniper-creosote junction); Location 4 = between Location 3 and south boundary within a creosote stand (Larea); and Location 5 = south boundary at a stand of Ocotillo (Ocotillo); and along an approximate east transect from location 3; Location 6 = Sepultura Canyon; and Location 7 = Cerro Montoso (increasing favorable juniper habitat and into pinyon). There were two other locations off the Sevilleta NWR in the first year: Location 8 at the Bosque del Apache (which later was lost during a fire at that location); Location 9 in the Magdelena Mountains west of Socorro.At all locations (except Bosque del Apache), litter of the three common species were included. Litter of different species were placed at locations where that litter may be dominant. The other litter types included: creosote (locations 2 and 4), blue grama (location 2), 4-wing saltbush (location 2), yucca (location 2), pinyon (location 7), cottonwood (location 8); and Arizona fescue, Douglas fir, Ponderosa pine, and aspen (location 9).At each location and for each species, the experimental design included placement of enough bags for three replicate bags per collection date; one collection at the time of placement and eight additional collections over a two year period, and 7 additional bags to allow for some mortality of bags (34 bags total). Each bag initially contained 5.00 g +/- 0.05 g (4.95-5.05g) air-dried material. Bags were placed at each location in late&#160;February, 1990. Collections are projected to be made in: (1), May 1990 (2), July 1990 (3), Sept. 1990 (4), January 1991 (5, one-year), May 1991 (6), Sept 1991 (7), and January 1992 (8, two-year).Changes in 1990:&#160;In 1990, litter was only placed at the Deep Well location (#2) and only litters of black grama, juniper, rice grass, creosote, blue grama and saltbush were used. It was decided that all the sites were not worth continuing because there were no other data associated with the site that could be used to explain why decomposition may or may not vary at that site versus and other site. Thus, the location with the most complete meteorological data was maintained (Deep Well, location 2).Changes 1991 through 1998:&#160;Starting with litter collected in the fall of 1991 and continuing through litter collected in 1997, litter bags were placed at four (4) locations that represented the range of climates present on the Sevilleta and that were all near meteorological stations. Deep Well (location 2) and Cerro Montoso (location 7) were retained from the previous work because they were near meteorological stations. Cerro Montoso (location 7) represented a &#160; &#160; &#160;pinyon-juniper forest, upper elevation climate (wettest of all locations), Deep Well (location 2) represented a short-grass prairie climate, a location near the Rio Salado (new, location 10) represented a Chihuahuan desert climate (driest of all locations), and Red Tank (new, location 11) represented a Great Basin grass-shrub climate. Deep Well and Cerro Montoso (location 1 and 7, respectively) are on the east side of the Sevilleta while Rio Salado and Red Tank (locations 10 and 11, respectively) are on the west.At these four locations, black grama, creosote, Indian rice grass, and juniper litter were placed every spring. Blue grama litter also was placed at Deep Well to maintain a long-term blue and black grama comparison.Changes in 1998:&#160;Beginning with placement of litter collected in the fall of 1998, efforts to conserve resources and to address changes across vegetation transition zones lead to addition of 2 new locations: Blue Springs (location 12), a juniper-short grass prairie mixture; and 5 points (location 13), a creosote area near the Deep Well short grass-desert grass area. No new litter was placed at Rio Salado and Red Tank (locations 10 and 11), but remaining &#160; &#160; litter were collected for the 1 year decomposition measurement in Feb. of 1999 and will be collected again in Feb. of 2000 for the two year decomposition measurement. The four common litter types were placed at Cerro Montoso, Blue Springs, Deep Well, and 5 points (locations 7, 12, 2, and 13, respectively) with blue grama also at Deep Well.&#160;Study Personnel: James R.

      <geographicDescription>Location: Deep Well is located on McKenzie Flats and is site of the longest running SEV LTER met station, number 40, which has been active since 1988.&#160; In addition to studies of meteorological variables, core line-intercept vegetation transects and line-intercept transects from the 1995 and 2001 Deep Well fires are sampled here.&#160; The mini-rhizotron study, blue and black grama compositional comparison, blue and black grama patch dynamics investigation, and kangaroo rat population assessement are all ongoing here.&#160; Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is also the location of the warming and monsoon experiments, as well as portions of the line-intercept and vegetation removal studies.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the area of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed.&#160; While portions of this site were burned, the entirety was not.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the fire.Vegetation: The vegetation of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and blue grama (B. gracilis).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Cerro Montosa Pinyon-Juniper site has been the location of major Sevilleta LTER research since 1989. Meteorological trends, net primary productivity, rodent and ground-dwelling arthropod populations, mycorrhizal responses to fertilizer, pinyon-juniper fruit and nut production, and pinyon mortality are all being investigated at this site. Previous studies have included analyses of pinyon tree rings for regional climate reconstruction.Vegetation: The vegetation is New Mexico Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, dominated by Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), and accompanied by gray oak (Quercus grisea).  There is a diverse shrub component, including scrub live oak (Q. turbinella), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), sacahuista (Nolina microcarpa), red barberry (Mahonia haematocarpa), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), skunkbush (Rhus trilobata), and banana yucca (Yucca baccata).  Grass diversity is also high, and open spaces between trees are dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), with hairy and sideoats grama (B. hirsuta and B. curtipendula) and black grama (B. eriopoda) also being significant. Other common grasses include purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), wolftail (Lycurus phleoides), mountain and ring muhly (M. montanus and M. torreyi), and New Mexican porcupinegrass (Heterostipa neomexicana). Common forbs include small-flowered milkvetch (Astragalus nuttallianus), white sagebrush (Artemesia ludoviciana), Fendler&#8217;s arabis (Arabis fendleri), Fendler&#8217;s sandmat (Chamaesyce fendleri), New Mexico thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum), false pennyroyal (Hedeoma oblongifolia), bastard sage (Eriogonum wrightii), ping&#252;e rubberweed (Hymenoxys richardsonii), large four o&#8217;clock (Mirabilis multiflora), Fendler's penstemon (Penstemon fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea hastulata and S. wrightii). , </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral  tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR,  flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and  Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and  ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites.  Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although  rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site  because the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are  co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location Met Station 44.The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power 	lines.&#160;  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the 	met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.&#160;Vegetation: The Rio Salado Larrea site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), with honey mesquite, fourwing saltbush, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra), and broom snakeweed as co-occurring shrubs. Dominant grasses are black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), and fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum). Common forb species include desert holly (Acourtia nana), spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa spp.), blackfoot daisey (Melampodium leucanthum), twinleaf (Senna bauhinoides), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala). While individual creosote bushes tend to be larger, overall plant cover is less than at the creosote core site at Five Points, with more exposed embedded stones and gravel on the soil surface, creating a pavement-like appearance., </geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Experimental Design: &#160;Setting up each location: 1989 through 1991:The design of this decomposition study includes placement of three (3) primary litter-types (black grama, juniper, and indian rice grass) at seven (7) locations. Litter of each species was collected after senescence in the fall. The grasses were clipped from standing plants before the litter was on the ground. All material that was not produced during the previous growing season was discarded. &#160;All reproductive parts were discarded. If there was any doubt about whether or not the material was produced that growing season, it was discarded. Juniper was collected from trees with senescent material or that had recently died and were still on the branch. Juniper litter consisted of only that material that still had bracts (woody stems without bracts were discarded). Pinyon was collected from trees that still retained senescent needles by shaking and capturing on a cloth or plastic sheet. &#160;Branches of 4-wing saltbush were trimmed from bushes in October when material looked senescent and leaves were picked from the branches and air-dried. Creosote leaves were attempted to be collected by spreading sheets on the ground; however, litterfall is very episodic and not enough material could be collected. Thus, creosote was collected by cutting live plants and drying in a forced-air oven at 60 &#176;C; then the freshly dried leaves were removed from the branch and any reproductive parts (seeds) were discarded. Yucca was collected by cutting leaves from a recently dead yucca plant. Cottonwood leaves were collected in plastic trays as they fell and before the fresh litter was rained on. Arizona fescue, douglas fir, ponderosa pine and aspen were collected by others and we do not know what methods were used. &#160;All litters were sorted and damaged material or reproductive parts were discarded. Unless previously dried, litter was air-dried in the laboratory. Litter bags consisted of coated fiberglass window screen material cut into 12 by 7.5 sheets, which were folded in half and two of the edges folded over and stapled. Litter was inserted through the unstapled edge, which then was folded over and stapled. Each bag initially contained 5.00 g (4.95-5.05 g) of air-dried material. For each litter type, a total of 34 bags were prepared for placement at each location. All the litter bags of one species for an individual location were placed in a separate bag and the bag was sealed for transport the field.At each location and for each species, the experimental design included placement of enough litter bags for three replicate bags per collection date; one collection at the time of placement, eight collections over a two year period, and 7 additional bags to allow for some mortality of bags (34 bags total per location).When the litter bags were placed at each location, the location was marked with fence posts as a warning. Each location was identified by a color-coded marker. The color-coded markers for each location are as follows: location (1)=plain, (2)=tan, (3)=green, (4)=orange, (5)=orange/green, (6)=tan/green, (7)=green/tan, (8)=green/orange, and (9)=tan/orange.Litter bags were placed on bare soil between plants at all times. Each litter bag was anchored by inserting a 16 penny nail through diagonal corners of the bag and into the ground. &#160;Decomposition bags with creosote, blue grama, yucca (tethered, not bagged), and four-wing saltbush all were placed at the deep well location (location 2); and cottonwood at the Bosque del Apache (location 8).In the fall of 1990, only 5 litter types (black grama, blue grama, juniper, creosote, and Indian ricegrass) were collected for placement in Feb. of 1991. Blue grama litter was only placed &#160; &#160; &#160; at Deep Well, while the four other litter types were place at 4 locations (#2, 7, 10, 11). Litter was collected as described in the previous year and bags were placed on bare soil at each location.In February of 1999, the Rio Salado and Red Tank sites did not get new litter bag placements; instead the new locations at Blue Springs and 5 points were established and the 4 common litter types were placed at these locations along with Deep Well and Cerro Montoso.Sample Collection Methods:For each individual location collection, three replicate bags are placed in zip-lock bags and are identified by species, field location, collector initials, and date of collection. A general maintenance survey of each location is done at this time by the collector(s). At the time of placement, three bags of each species were collected and placed into a gallon-sized zip-loc bag for transport to the lab. This method insured that each replicate was handled the same way with bouncing during transport and sample handling consistent for all samples. These three samples taken at the time of placement determine the starting (incubation in the field time 0) replicate litters. For each collection date, 28 gallon-size zip-lock bags were be needed.Sample Analysis Methods:Overview:&#160;Handling of the field samples involves three phases: (1) initial cleaning and oven-dry weight; (2) grinding and ash correction; and (3) chemical analyses. Once in the laboratory, field samples will come in with 3 replications/plant type in a bag labelled with the site, plant material, and collection date. In Phase 1, the samples are cleaned, oven dried at 60&#176; C for a minimum of 24 hours, and oven-dry weight recorded. The &#160;samples are then transferred to coin envelopes, ground on the Tecator grinder, and stored back in the coin envelope. In Phase 2, ground plant material is then used for ash-free weight determinations. In Phase 3, the remaining ground plant litter is used for chemical analyses.Phase 1.&#160;WEIGHING&#160;1. &#160;A zip-loc bag with field samples &#160;is selected to begin weighing out. One mesh bag is selected and &#160;this sample was arbitrarily assigned as a replicate number and Sample ID number. Any foreign material was removed from the outside of the bag, such as: differen plant material, mud, ROCKS, etc, making sure to lift up the side folds to release any trapped rocks. &#160;The weighed and labelled weigh boat was placed on a sheet of paper and the contents of the bag were emptied into the weigh boat. This was repeated for all samples and the samples were placed in the oven.&#160;2. &#160;Samples were dried for a minimum of 24 hours at 60&#176; C. Samples were weighed and weights were recorded in the record book. &#160;Samples were then placed into a coin envelope labelled with the collection date, site number, plant type, and Sample ID number.GRINDING&#160;Plant material was ground in order to perform ash-free weight corrections and chemical &#160;analyses. The only plant material needed to be ground using liquid N were: pinyon, juniper and creosote. All others were ground warm.Phase 2.&#160;ASH-FREE WEIGHT CORRECTION METHOD&#160;Methods 1989 through 1991:&#160;ASH THE EMPTY CRUCIBLES: Line up a sufficient quantity (about 40) of the tall, narrow, numbered porcelain crucibles. Wipe them out with a Kimwipe. Load them into the muffle furnace making sure not to touch the oven sides or each other. Use the shelf to fit them all in. Close the muffle furnace. Turn on the exhaust fan. Turn the controller to 5.0, and turn the timer to 2 hours. After about 1.5 - 1.75 hours, check to verify that the temperature has or will reached 500 &#176;C. &#160;If it hasn't, add additional time to the controller. When it does hit 500 &#176;C, it is hot enough and ready to shut off. Let cool, closed, overnight. The next day the crucibles can be removed and stored in a desiccator.DRY THE GROUND MATERIAL: The ground material in their envelopes &#160;was placed in a 60 &#176;C oven for 24 hours prior to weighing out for ashing. When the crucibles are thoroughly cooled, weigh the empty crucible and then place out approximately 1 gram using the analytical balance (BE SURE TO MIX THE SAMPLE WELL BECAUSE PARTICLES TEND TO SEPARATE DURING STORAGE AND HANDLING) of ground material into the crucible, and then record the filled crucible weight on the data charts in the front of this book. Remember to weigh and include a blank (empty) crucible with each run.ASH THE WEIGHED SAMPLE: &#160;Using tongs, load the crucibles into the muffle furnace, making sure not to touch the oven sides or each other. Use the shelf to fit them all in. Close the muffle furnace. Turn on the exhaust fan. Turn the controller to 5.0, and turn the timer to 2 hours. After about 1.5 - 1.75 hours, check to verify that the temperature has reached 500 &#176;C. If it hasn't, add an extra 15 minutes to the timing. When it does hit 500&#176;C, and the timer has turned off the furnace, turn the controller to 2.0, and the timer to 2 hours. Let cool, closed, overnight.WEIGH THE ASHED SAMPLES: Using tongs, remove the crucibles to a desiccator. When they are thoroughly cooled, use the same analytical balance and record the filled crucible weight on the data charts in the front of this book. Remember to weigh and include the blank (empty) crucible from each run. Dump out the ashed sample into the garbage, wiping the crucible with a Kimwipe if necessary. The crucibles are now ready to be filled again and fired.&#160;Methods after 1991:&#160;Ashing methods were changed in 1991 when the use of porcelain crucibles was replaced by use of disposable aluminum boats. All methods stayed the same EXCEPT: The disposable aluminum boats did not need to be 'tared' or fired before use. The clean boats were taken directly from the package and placed into use. To identify the boat, the SAMPLE ID # was 'written' (etched indented with a pencil-pen) on the bottom of the boat. The boat weight was recorded and the sample (WITH MIXING!) was added (about 1 gram). The rest of the procedures remained the same. If the muffle furnace was allowed to exceed 550 &#176;C, the aluminum boats would melt and significant changes in their weight could occur. Blank boats are run with each operation to insure no significant loss-gain during firing.Analytical Methods Used:Kjeldahl Nitrogen and Phosphorus by Technicon Industrial Method No. 369-75A (Revised 8/21/75) Digestion and sample preparation for the analysis of total kjeldahl nitrogen and/or phosphorus in food and agricultural products using the technicon BD-20 Block digestor and Technicon Industrial Method 334-74A (revised 8/21/75) Individual/simultaneous determination on nitrogen and phosphorus in BD acid digests.Percent Nitrogen and Percent Carbon were determined by High Temperature combustion, the resulting gases were eluted on a gas chromatography column and detected by thermal conductivity and integrated to yield carbon and nitrogen content. &#160;Analyses were performed on a ThermoQuest CE Instruments NC2100 Elemental Analyzer, ThermoQuest Italia S.p.A., Rodano, Italy. &#160;</literalLayout>
