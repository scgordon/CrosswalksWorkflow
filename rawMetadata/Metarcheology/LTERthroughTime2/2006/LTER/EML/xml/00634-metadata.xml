The file format was suggested by the LTER data manager, to conform with the relational database structure. On 4 Dec 1998, the file was submitted to Denise Steigerwald, the MCM LTER data manager, located at INSTAAR, University of Colorado.
                        
                        Upon arrival at INSTAAR, the data manager removed columns for latitude and longitude, and updated the location names to match those provided in the "soil measurement locations" file (from which latitude and longitude can be found). The resulting file was reformatted to present in ascii, comma delimited text and MS-DOS text (table layout) on the MCM LTER web site. Both of these files are linked to this web page above.</literalLayout></para></section></description></maintenance><contact scope="document"><organizationName>McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Mexico</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>MSC03 2020</deliveryPoint><city>Albuquerque</city><administrativeArea>NM</administrativeArea><postalCode>87131</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">505-277-3418</phone><phone phonetype="fax">505-277-0304</phone><electronicMailAddress>mcmdata@lternet.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Mexico</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>MSC03 2020</deliveryPoint><city>Albuquerque</city><administrativeArea>NM</administrativeArea><postalCode>87131</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">505-277-3418</phone><phone phonetype="fax">505-277-0304</phone><electronicMailAddress>mcmdata@lternet.edu</electronicMailAddress></publisher><methods><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>The experimental design is a randomized block, with 5 replicates per
treatment.  Within each block were 3 plots measuring approximately 1m x 1m, with a
central circular area of 85 cm diameter (approx.  0.57 m2) used for
treatments and sampling.  The treatments were as follows:

(C) control plots (no manipulations), 
(W) nanopure water added to field capacity to 10 cm depth (5.6 L/plot), 
(WS) sucrose added in solution (15.82 g sucrose in 5.6 L water per plot).

  
	  
Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and moisture content analysis as
follows:  Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean
plastic scoop per sample.  Samples were taken from within the 85 cm diameter circular
area of each plot starting at the 12:00 position on the first day.  The above
treatments were then applied to the plots.  The 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions were
then sampled for each successive date.  The location of the sampling was recorded
each time so that areas were not re-sampled.  Using the plastic scoop, soil was
collected to a 10 cm depth.  Very large rocks (&gt;20 mm diameter) were excluded from the
sample.  The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full
(about 1.5 kg soil).  The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed
tightly, expelling as much air as possible.  The soil samples were stored in a cooler
for transportation.  On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the
soils were stored at 5 degrees C until further processing.  


In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent
contamination.  The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening.  A
sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum soil
can, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g.  This sample was dried at 105 degrees C for
24 hours.  The sample was removed, placed in a desiccator to cool down, and
re-weighed.  These data were used to calculate water content of the soil.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>Units_and_Column_Descriptions</entityName><physical scope="document"><objectName>Units_and_Column_Descriptions</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><numFooterLines>0</numFooterLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter><quoteCharacter>"</quoteCharacter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://www.mcmlter.org/data/soils/short-term/9511stso.dat</url></online></distribution></physical><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>LOCATION</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Name of area where measurement was made</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Name of area where measurement was made</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>DATE</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Date on which sample was gathered</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Date" /><measurementScale><dateTime><formatString>mm/dd/yy</formatString></dateTime></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>SAMPLE#</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Sample ID</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Sample ID</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>SOIL WATER CONTENT (%)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Percent water found in soil</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Number" /><measurementScale><ratio><unit><customUnit>percent</customUnit></unit><precision>0.0001</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType><bounds><minimum exclusive="false">0</minimum><maximum exclusive="false">100</maximum></bounds></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required Entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>COMMENTS</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Helpful hints about the sample</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Helpful hints about the sample</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>FILE NAME</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Name of file in which data was stored</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Name of file in which data was stored</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList></dataTable></dataset><additionalMetadata><metadata><unitList><unit id="percent" /></unitList></metadata></additionalMetadata></ns0:eml>
