     The meteorological system which was in place prior to Hurricane Hugo at
     the Baruch Marine Laboratory was designed by the Climatronics Corporation
     of Bohemia, NY. (Job number 7244 on March 3, 1982).  The system consisted
     of a remote meteorological system with telemetry and an IMP 803 cassette
     data acquisition system.

     System Description

     The system was designed to measure and transmit wind speed, wind 
     direction, air temperature, barometric pressure, solar radiation, 
     precipitation, water level, water temperature and conductivity data.
     This consisted of the following components:

         Remote Site

     1.  Wind Speed and Direction sensors with cross arm
            Climatronics Wind Mark III  
     2.  Naturally Aspirated Temperature Shield w/
            YSI 703 -  Dual Element Air Temperature Thermistor
     3.  Solar Radiation sensor with mount
            Eppley radiometer
     4.  Barometric Pressure sensor
            YSI transducer
     5.  Precipitation Gage
            Belfort Instruments tipping bucket gauge
     6.  Water Depth
             Enviro-Labs Water Level sensor
     7.  Water Temperature
             YSI 701 - Water Temperature Thermistor
     8.  Conductivity Meter
             YSI Conductivity Sensor, glass conductivity cell and
             temperature compensator
     9.  Remote Meteorological System mainframe in a NEMA
         environmental Enclosure (with mounting hardware),
         housing the following equipment: 
           signal conditioning electronics, Modem Transmitter,
           conductivity meter and line protectors.
     10. 10 Meter Aluminum Tower with guying kit
     11. Cables, connectors and a sensor mounting boom



     The system was configured as follows:
     The wind cross arm was mounted to the 4 foot extension mast located
     at the top of the tower.  The temperature shield and solar radiation
     sensor were mounted on a tower boom near the top of the tower.  The
     precipitation gage was mounted on a level surface approximately 20
     meters from the tower base.  The barometric pressure sensor was mounted
     inside of the NEMA enclosure .  The water temperature, water level and
     conductivity cables were placed in a rigid PVC well in the water.

     All of the sensor cables were wired through the signal line
     protector except the conductivity cell.  The remote meteorological
     site's NEMA enclosure housed the signal conditioning electronics,
     the conductivity meter, an AC/DC converter and a battery back-up
     pack.

         Base Site

     1.  Pre-wired Instrument Cabinet containing a mainframe with a power
         supply and Modem Receiver, a multiplexing (MUX) recorder and
         an IMP-803 Microprocessor based Cassette Data Acquisition System.
     2.  2,500 feet of telemetry cable.

     All sensors were scanned once per second except the following:
     Wind Direction -  Mean of 120 scans per hour
     Water Level, Precipitation - instantaneous values at the time indicated

     These readings are 24 hours per day, every day of the year beginning
     June 3, 1982 except when individual probes or the entire meteorological
     station was down.


                               *** NOTE ***
                      Sept. 21, 1989 through Dec. 31 1990
                     NCAR Temporary Meteorological Station
     
     The Meteorological system used during this time period was
     borrowed from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder
     Colorado. NCAR designed and built the system.  This system sent
     a signal every 15 minutes by satellite to a computer at NCAR in
     Boulder, CO.  Once there, the data were recorded to tapes.  These
     tapes were then sent to the Baruch Marine Laboratory. The data were
     reformatted and downloaded by the University of South Carolina,     Computer Services Division.

     The NCAR system was designed tomeasure and transmit windspeed, wind direction, dry air temperature, wet air temperature,
     barometric pressure, solar radiation, precipitation, Dew Point,
     and Relative Humidity data.


     Post Dec. 31, 1990

     The current meteorological system was designed by Climatronics
     Corp.  It is a Campbell Scientific CR10 measurement and control
     module.  The system was designed to measure and transmit wind speed,
     wind direction, air temperature, barometric pressure, solar
     radiation, precipitation, water level, water temperature and
     conductivity data.  This system consists of the following components.

                                Remote Site

     1.  Wind Speed and Direction sensors with cross arm
            Climatronics Wind Mark III  
     2.  Naturally Aspirated Temperature Shield w/ 
            YSI 703 -  Dual element Air Temperature Thermistor
     3.  Solar Radiation sensor with mount
            Eppley 8-48 radiometer
     4.  Barometric Pressure sensor
            YSI 2014 transducer
     5.  Precipitation Gage
            Sierra-Misco 2500-8 Tipping bucket Precipitation gauge.
            (This sensor has not been installed as of November 1992,
            due to logistic problems with the new sea water lines in the
            board walk.)
     6.  Water Depth
             Keller PSI PT108V-50-15PSI Water Level sensor
     7.  Water Temperature
             YSI 070/44018/NA/RN/300 - Water Temperature Thermistor
     8.  Conductivity Meter
             Rosemont 1181T-00-02-99 Water Conductivity probe.
     9.  Remote Meteorological System mainframe in a NEMA
         environmental enclosure (with mounting hardware),
         housing the following equipment: 
         signal conditioning electronics, modem transmitter,
         conductivity meter and line protectors, CR10 data logger
     10. 10 Meter Aluminum Tower with guying kit
     11. Cables, connectors and a sensor mounting boom.

     As of November 1992:

     Because the field laboratory has not been completely reconstructed,
     the remote phone line has not been installed to the Met station tower.
     Therefore, once a week the storage module that records data is
     retrieved from the field, and the data are downloaded to the
     PC in the data management office using a program called SMCOM,
     written by Campbell Scientific.  These data are reformatted and
     appended to the yearly data set.  The data are archived in six month
     blocks.

     The system is configured as follows:
     The wind cross arm is mounted to the 4 foot extension mast located
     at the top of the tower.  The temperature shield and solar radiation
     sensor are mounted on the tower boom near the top of the tower.  The
     barometric pressure sensor is mounted outside of the NEMA enclosure.
     The water temperature, water level and conductivity cables are placed
     in a rigid PVC well in the water.

     All of the sensor cables are wired through the signal line
     protector.  The remote meteorological site's NEMA enclosure houses
     the Campbell control module, the storage module, the Rosemont
     conductivity transmitter, and a backup 12 volt battery.
     The primary power source is a solar panel.

     All sensors are scanned once a second, and an hourly mean is 
     generated on the hour.  Water Level is the only exception.  On 
     the Raw data, a six minute instantaneous value is recorded. and
     an hourly instantaneous value is recorded on the hour.  The six 
     minute reading is discarded from the final data set.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Experimental Design</title><para><literalLayout>Monitoring of meteorological paramaters at Oyster Landing, North Inlet,
