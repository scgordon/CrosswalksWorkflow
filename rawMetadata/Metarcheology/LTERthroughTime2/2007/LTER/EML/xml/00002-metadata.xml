      <para>Reptile populations were sampled in spring and summer in various habitats: grassland, creosote shrubland, pinyon-juniper woodland, cottonwood forest, subalpine forest, and subalpine meadow. On 18 sites mark-release methods were used; on 12 sites, all animals were kept for museum specimens. Museum specimen preparations included skulls, whole skeletons, and alcohol preservations; all specimens had tissue samples (liver, heart) taken for ultra-cold preservations for genetic analyses; some were karyotyped. All museum specimens were checked for internal parasites.</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points Black Grama is on the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitat. The site is subject to intensive research activity, including assessments of net primary productivity, phenology, and pollinator diversity, amongst other projects.&#160; It is the site of the unburned black grama (GU) component of the Burn NPP study.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the Five Points Black Grama site.&#160; Portions of this site were burned, but not the entirety.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the burn.
&#160;Vegetation: The Five Points Black Grama site is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda)., </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral  tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR,  flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and  Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and  ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites.  Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although  rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site  because the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are  co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location Met Station 44.The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power 	lines.&#160;  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the 	met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.&#160;Vegetation: The Rio Salado Larrea site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), with honey mesquite, fourwing saltbush, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra), and broom snakeweed as co-occurring shrubs. Dominant grasses are black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), and fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum). Common forb species include desert holly (Acourtia nana), spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa spp.), blackfoot daisey (Melampodium leucanthum), twinleaf (Senna bauhinoides), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala). While individual creosote bushes tend to be larger, overall plant cover is less than at the creosote core site at Five Points, with more exposed embedded stones and gravel on the soil surface, creating a pavement-like appearance., </geographicDescription>

stabilized deep-sand dominated by coppice dunes of honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa). Co-dominant shrubs are sand sagebrush (Artemesia filifolia) and
fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), with winterfat (Krascheninnikovia
lanata), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), broom indigobush (Psorothamnus
scoparius), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia
sarothrae) as other notable shrubs. One-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) is
present as well, especially along shallow washes. Compared to the Black Grama
Core Site, grass cover is sparse and dominated by poverty threeawn (Aristida
divaricata), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), mesa and spike dropseed
(Sporobolus cryptandrus and S. contractus), as well as patches of black grama
(Bouteloua eriopoda). Notable forbs included spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa
wislizenii), tansy aster (Machaeranthera tanacetifolia), desert marigold
(Baileya multiradiata), Abert buckwheat (Eriogonum abertianum), dwarf gilia
(Ipomopsis pumila), rattlesnake weed (Chamaesyce albomarginata), blunt

      <geographicDescription>Location: Ladron Foothills sites include Red Tank and Two-22 in the foothills of the Sierra Ladrones on the West side of the refuge.Soils: Soils in the Arroyo Riparian area are loose granitic gravel with many rocks and boulders., Vegetation: Two-22 site is characterized as Juniper Savanna/Arroyo Riparian (Dick-Peddie 1993).  Two-22 trapping webs span 2 two vegetation types. The upland Juniper Savanna portion of the site is dominated by widely scattered, relatively small stature one-seed Juniper. Other shrubs are sparse, including scrub liveoak, skunkbush, tree cholla, pricklypear, and banana and soapweed yucca. Rocky open spaces are dominated by black, hairy, and blue grama. The lower Arroyo Riparian area consists of a more dense, more diverse vegetation, dominated by large specimens of scrub liveoak, one-seed juniper and Apache plume, as well as tree cholla, Engelman cholla (O. engelmanii), pricklypear, broom snakeweed, tarragon (Artemesia dracunculus), sacahuista, chamisa (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), fourwing saltbush, wolfberry (Lycium pallidum), and skunkbush. Grass diversity is relatively high and dominated by blue grama and bush muhly., </geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Livetrapping of lizards and snakes on the Sevilleta was done by using pitfall traps connected with drift fences. &#160;A pitfall trap consisted of two large ( 10) cans connected end to end resulting in a trap approximately 44 cm deep and 15 cm in diameter. &#160;The traps were inserted into the ground so the tops are flush. &#160;Two pitfalls were placed into the ground approximately 6 meters apart and connected with a 12 cm tall aluminum flashing fence. &#160;The fence guided the reptiles into the pitfall traps.There were 24 pitfall traps per web (12 sets) totaling 120 per site. Seventy-two of these were for mark and recapture studies, while the remaining 48 werefor the collection of museum specimens.The pitfalls were covered with aluminum flashing lids that sit approximately 2.5 cm off the ground. &#160;The lids provided complete shade and protection from precipitation. &#160;The trap floors were also punctured to permit drainage if necessary.The pitfall traps were opened for three weeks at a time, and were checked every two or three days by a crew of two to five. &#160;At the end of the three weeks they were closed by covering the openings with a square ceramic tile, 20 cm per side. &#160;The edges of the tiles were then covered with dirt as an extra safeguard against penetration. All pitfalls were checked for the presence of animals by removing the aluminum lids and visually inspecting each trap's interior. &#160;Lizards found in the traps on the collection webs were removed from the traps, placed in plastic bags with an adequate supply of air, and transported to the lab for processing. &#160;Lizards found in pitfalls on&#160;mark-recapture webs were removed by hand, then identified to species level, checked for previous capture and individual identification marks, measured, weighed and sexed. &#160;The lizards were toe-clipped with no more than two toes cut per foot, and the longest toes on the hind feet left intact.All snakes were identified to species level, and non-venomous snakes were measured and weighed but not marked because so few are captured. Venomous snakes were removed from pitfalls by the head animal technician using a "snake stick" which enabled the user to handle snakes safely without injury to the snake.All lizards and snakes are released at the exact location of capture.</literalLayout>
