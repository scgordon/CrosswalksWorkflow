Stream enrichment increases leaf decomposition rates, alters benthic invertebrate community structure, and increases invertebrate secondary production (Cross 2004; Greenwood 2004). However, stream systems are linked to their surrounding terrestrial system via aquatic insect emergence; an aquatic subsidy of terrestrial food webs (Jackson and Fisher 1986; Sanzone et. al. 2003) and a possible pathway for changes in aquatic systems to impact terrestrial systems. Because resource subsidies typically flow down a productivity gradient, an increase in the productivity of a donor system may increase this resource subsidy and alter the food web dynamics of the recipient system (e.g., Sanzone 2001, Polis et. al. 1997). Since July 2000, we have been continuously enriching a first order headwater stream and have facilitated increased aquatic invertebrate production (Cross 2004), which may increase the aquatic insect subsidy to the terrestrial system. Therefore, changes in food web dynamics caused by nutrient enrichment may not be limited to aquatic systems, but may also cascade through the terrestrial system with unknown effects. To better understand how aquatic and terrestrial systems are linked, I will test whether stream nutrient enrichment increases aquatic subsidies to terrestrial systems. Using a 15N stable isotope tracer I will test three predictions. Prediction 1: Aquatic insect emergence subsidizes near-stream terrestrial spiders more than upland spiders. Prediction 2: Aquatic insect subsidies increase spider abundance, richness, and biomass near streams when compared to upland habitats. Prediction 3: Stream nutrient enrichment increases this aquatic subsidy.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>spider</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary3062_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>WS53, WS54</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2005-04-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-06-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
