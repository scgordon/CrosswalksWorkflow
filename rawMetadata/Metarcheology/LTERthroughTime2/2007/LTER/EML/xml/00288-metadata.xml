The three stream sites at Coweeta will the reference sites for studies in the Little Tennessee Basin.  Our research will evaluate whether streams are important sites of N retention in the landscape and, more importantly, how human disturbances affect that retention. We will use field 15N-tracer experiments to determine the rates and factors controlling nitrate uptake and retention in relatively pristine streams and in streams that have been altered by agriculture or urban development and have elevated nitrate levels. These experiments and associated measurements will allow us to test a variety of hypotheses dealing with the impacts of human disturbances on streams, including effects on channel morphology, hydraulics, biological activity, and N retention. At each of eight sites distributed across diverse biomes throughout the U.S., we will perform tracer-level 15N-nitrate addition experiments to trace the fate of nitrate in nine streams: 3 reference, 3 agricultural and 3 urban streams (for a total of 72 streams across all sites). Each experiment will consist of a 24-h addition of 15N-nitrate and longitudinally distributed measurements of 15N in water and in various benthic organic matter pools to determine in-situ rates of nitrification, assimilatory uptake of nitrate, and denitrification in each stream. We will use our experimental results to develop a general, process-based model of nitrate retention in stream reaches. We then will extend our results to much larger spatial scales by combining our stream model with GIS-based information on hydrography and land use to predict nitrate retention in 5th or 6th order river basins at each of the eight study sites. We will test these predictions with synoptic field measurements of stream nitrate concentrations within each basin. The validated river basin model will be an important land-use planning and management tool for controlling the N loading of lakes and coastal ecosystems.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>hyporheic</keyword><keyword>nitrate</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary3058_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Hugh White Creek 278222, 3881527; Ball Creek 276195, 3880467</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-05-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-11-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
