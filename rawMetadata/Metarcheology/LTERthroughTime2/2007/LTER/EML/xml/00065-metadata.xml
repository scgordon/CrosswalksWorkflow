The oaks are a major component of southern Appalachian forests and are also major components of the allochthonous organic matter that provides energy to southern Appalachian streams. Oaks are susceptible to a variety of defoliators including the gypsy moth which is gradually moving down the spine of the Blue Ridge Mts. and will likely eventually reach Coweeta and the surrounding mountains. American chestnut was at one time a dominant forest tree in the southern Appalachians but is now virtually extinct except for snags that grow from old stumps and roots. We have documented that litter breakdown of various leaf species is consistently faster in Big Hurricane Branch than in Hugh White Creek and this has been the case over the last 20 years or so. This study will compare breakdown rates of two major canopy trees of the maturing forest in the two stream types to develop background information on the importance of potential loss of substantial numbers of these two tree species to gypsy moth defoliation. The chestnut experiment is being done in an attempt to gain some historical perspective on how the loss of a key canopy species might have affected stream detritus dynamics.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>hyporheic</keyword><keyword>litter</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary3057_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Three first order tribs (T) on Hugh White Creek.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
