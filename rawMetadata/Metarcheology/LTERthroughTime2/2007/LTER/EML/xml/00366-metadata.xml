Recent interest has focused on impacts of invasive, exotic earthworms on soil processes, particularly in temperate regions. Dramatic effects of introduced earthworms on soil organic matter dynamics have been reported in a number of cases. The focus of nearly all of this work has been on a few species of exotic earthworms which have achieved wide distributions and now dominate the soil fauna in many ecosystems. Moreover, the most dramatic effects of exotic species on soil organic matter dynamics have been observed in areas previously uninhabited by earthworms (e.g., north of Pleistocene glacial margins in North America). Such effects have rarely been reported from invasions of ecosystems inhabited by native earthworm assemblages, particularly where soils are undisturbed. These observations lead to the central hypothesis of this proposal--endemic earthworm fauna and/or characteristics of their native habitats are resistant to invasion by exotic earthworm species and, consequently, will reduce the impact of exotic species on soil processes. Objectives of this proposed work are to address the following questions: A) Do native earthworm species maintain exclusivity or dominance over exotic earthworm species in undisturbed, native ecosystems? Three hypotheses will be tested concerning mechanisms by which exotic earthworms may succeed or fail to invade a range of habitats occupied exclusively by native earthworms: 1) propagule pressure hypothesis; 2) habitat matching hypothesis; and 3) biotic resistance hypothesis B) Are the impacts of exotic earthworm species on soil processes reduced in the presence of native earthworm species in their native ecosystems? Effects will be determined of native and exotic earthworms and their interactions on transformations of soil organic matter in O- and A-horizons by measuring: 1) physical and chemical nature of organic and mineral soil horizons; 2) movements of 13C from labeled litter through O- and A-horizons and into organic matter fractions in the mineral soil.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>earthworms</keyword><keyword>soil</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1097_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>None available.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-11-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2008-11-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
