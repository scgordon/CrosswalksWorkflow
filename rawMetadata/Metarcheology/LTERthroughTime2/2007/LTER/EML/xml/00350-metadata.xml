Routine measurements of ice cover on Mirror Lake began in 1967; however the exact date of onset (ice in) in 1967 is uncertain so the data shown here begins in 1968.  Dates for ice in and dissipation (ice out) of ice cover have been recorded using criteria that have been followed faithfully since the beginning of the study.  The date of ice in is taken when greater than 50% of the lake surface is covered with ice and remains covered.  The date of ice out is taken when &gt; 50% of the lake surface is open water and the lake&#8217;s surface does not refreeze.</literalLayout></para></section></description><citation scope="document"><title>A long-term record of ice-cover for Mirror Lake, New Hampshire: effects of global warming?</title><creator id="likens" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>G.E.</givenName><surName>Likens</surName></individualName></creator><pubDate>2000</pubDate><language>english</language><article><journal>Verhandlungen Internationale Vereinigung f&#252;r theoretische und angewandte Limnologie</journal><volume>27</volume><pageRange>2765-2769</pageRange></article></citation></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=HBR,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>ml_ice</entityName><entityDescription>Mirror Lake Ice Cover</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>ml_ice.txt</objectName><characterEncoding>ASCII</characterEncoding><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n\r</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://www.hubbardbrook.org/data/data_policy.php?firstname=metacat&amp;lastname=user&amp;affiliation=Other&amp;view=1&amp;accept=1&amp;comments=none&amp;phone=6035551212&amp;email=none@loopback.com&amp;target=ml_ice.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><additionalInfo><section><title>DATA DESCRIPTION:</title><para><literalLayout>These data are physically stored at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Robert S.
