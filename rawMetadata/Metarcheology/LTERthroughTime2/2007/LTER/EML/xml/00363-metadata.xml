I investigated the vertical distribution, of ericoid (ERM) ecto- (ECM), arbuscular (AM), and mycorrhizal fungi in a soil at Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, Otto, N.C., and attempted to determine if this spatial distribution was correlated with N and P fraction distribution. The soil studied maintained host plants for all three mycorrhizal fungi, Rhododendron maximum (ERM), Tsuga canadensis (ECM), Liriodendron tulipifera (AM).. We utilized DNA sequencing to determine mycorrhizal fungal distribution. Sequences were identified using BLAST searches and by utilizing Maximum-Likelihood analysis. The correlation between mycorrhizal fungal distribution and N and P distribution was tested using Principal Component Analysis. The results indicate that the three mycorrhizal types are differentially distributed throughout soil horizons. ERM fungi occurred predominately in O horizons and AM fungi occurred mainly in B horizons. The majority of ECM fungi were located within the A horizon but were found in the O and B as well. ERM fungi were positively correlated with high concentrations of inorganic N and organic N and P. AM fungi were negatively correlated with inorganic and organic N, while ECM occurred throughout the range of N and P fraction distribution. I hypothesize that this fungal distribution relates to the capacity of each fungal type to utilize various soil substrates as nutrient sources. As a secondary study, I investigated the impact that different mycorrhizal types have on root system architecture. Using PCR and sequencing, I identified the different mycorrhiza occurring on roots of each of the three host species. I then used scanned images of each root fragment to determine several topological parameters including altitude, magnitude, and total exterior path-length. Comparisons of the topology of roots colonized by different mycorrhizae indicate that different ECM groups do not have a noticeable effect on the parameters measured. Other comparisons could not be made due to a lack of AM and ERM diversity on the roots tested.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>ectomycorrhizae</keyword><keyword>root</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1101_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>4 plots along Shope Fork Rd.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2001-05-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2004-05-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
