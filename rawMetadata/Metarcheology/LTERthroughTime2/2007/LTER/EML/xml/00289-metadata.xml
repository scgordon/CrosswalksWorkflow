The REP is tasked to identify and characterize fractured rock aquifers within various hydrogeologic settings in the Piedmont and mountains of N.C. Planners, scientists, educators, and the public are using the REP findings to understand, develop and protect Western NC&#65533;s ground water supplies. This work would utilize historic data collected in the Coweeta watershed (stream gage, soils, precipitation, and surface water quality data, geologic mapping, and others) and would compliment the research being conducted as part of the Long Term Ecological Project at Coweeta. One of the goals of the REP is to develop an understanding of the ground water occurrence, quality, and movement within the major rock types that comprise the Piedmont and mountains of NC. The Coweeta basin represents a rock type that has not been fully characterized. Specifically, Coweeta is underlain by, among other rock types, a Precambrian-age biotite gneiss of the Tallulah Falls Formation of the Blue Ridge Belt, a geology that is prevalent throughout much of Western NC. In Subbasin 34 the biotite gneiss is interlayered with pelitic schist and metagraywackes, and a body of ultramafic amphibolite and horneblend gneiss occurs near the ridgeline. Topography within the 82-acre Subbasin 34 is fairly steep and extends from about 3900 ft above mean seal level (msl) along the ridgeline to about 2900 ft msl at Shope Fork. Ground water discharge occurs along Bee Branch and Shope Fork. Bee Branch is a tributary to Shope Fork, which in turn empties into Coweeta Creek. Coweeta Creek empties into the Little Tennessee River. Gage records exist for Bee Branch back to 1938. A wide range of hydrogeologic data would be collected and analyzed for the basin, and findings would be compared to those of other hydrogeologic settings in the Inner Piedmont and Blue Ridge Belts of western NC.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary3063_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Subbasin 34, Coweeta Watershed</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2005-03-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2010-12-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
