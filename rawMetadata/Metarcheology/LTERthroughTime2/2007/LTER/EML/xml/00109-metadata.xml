We have observed remarkable changes in the production of heterotrophic microbes and invertebrates, and consequent effects on ecosystem function in terms of decomposition rates and carbon balance. As a result of our long-term nutrient enrichment, fungal production and activity dramatically increased, decay rates of leaf litter increased, benthic organic matter standing crop has been reduced and export of fine particulate organic matter has increased. Long-term data from these streams indicate that benthic invertebrate production is highly correlated with benthic organic matter. Thus, despite increased invertebrate biomass and production we observed after 2 years of enrichment, we predict that over longer time scales (&gt; 4 yr.), annual invertebrate production will return to a lower stable mean in the treatment stream, based on carbon limitation. The first objective of this study was to continue the nutrient enrichment of this headwater stream for one year to examine longer-term trends in system changes. The effects we have observed in this system have been largely driven by fungal rather than bacterial response, suggesting a keystone role of fungi in driving the response of a detritus-based system to nutrient enrichment. The second objective of the study, therefore, is to determine the role of fungi in controlling the system-wide response to nutrient addition. We are currently testing the keystone role of fungi by reducing fungal response to enrichment (by continuous addition of a fungicide) and measuring changes in the response of other variables. Critical to our predictions is whether there is a synergistic, facilitative relationship between fungi and bacteria, or whether these groups of microbes compete (e.g., for labile carbon or nutrients). Whether bacteria respond positively or negatively to reductions in fungi will test these alternative hypotheses. To the extent that microbial diversity and production is important to invertebrate production and ecosystem function will also be shown via differences in production and litter processing following reductions in fungi. This study will add to our understanding of mechanisms driving detritus-based system response to nutrient enrichment and the role of microbial diversity in ecosystem functioning.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary3067.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Watersheds 53 and 54.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-07-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2007-03-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
