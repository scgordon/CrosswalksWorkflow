    <abstract>
      <para>The objective of this study was to investigate in detail the molecular characteristics of DOM in a sub-tropical, oligotrophic aquatic environment, namely the Florida coastal Everglades, along a freshwater wetland, mangrove fringe to estuarine transect.  For this purpose, surface waters from five sites along Taylor Slough ranging from freshwater marsh to mangrove ecotone environments, as well as three sites within the Florida Bay estuary were collected for analyses.  Fluorescence properties of DOM were measured for a quick assessment of DOM quality. Ultrafiltered DOM samples (UDOM; less than 0.7 um, greater than 1000 Da) were concentrated and freeze dried for the determination of bulk C composition, lignin-phenol concentration, and neutral sugar composition. These molecular characteristics were investigated by 13C-NMR spectroscopy, TMAH thermochemolysis, and hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), respectively.  Furthermore, UDOM samples were classified by cluster analysis based on their pyrolysis products obtained via flash pyrolysis-GC/MS.</para>

          <para>DOC concentrations were analyzed using a high temperature catalytic combustion method on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 total organic carbon analyzer.  Samples (4 ml) were acidified with 10ul of conc. HCl and sparged for 5 min with nitrogen (150 ml min-1) to remove inorganic carbon.  The mean of three to six injections was reported for each sample.  Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrometer equipped with a 150-W Xenon arc lamp as the light source.  The emission monochromator was scanned from 250 to 550 nm with excitation at 313 and 370 nm (Donard et al. 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994).  Further, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence spectra at a constant offset value between emission and excitation wavelength of 30 nm were measured from 250 to 550 nm (Lu et al. 2003; Jaffe et al. 2004).  Both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm.  Absorbance of the DOM solution was scanned from 250 to 550 nm for the correction of inner-filter effects on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  The inner-filter effects were corrected for all the spectra following the procedure described by McKnight et al. (2001).  Spectra were not corrected for instrumental response.  Milli-Q water was used as a blank to background substract water Raman scatter peaks.  The fluorescence intensities were expressed in quinine sulfate units (QSU); 1 QSU = 1 ug L-1 of quinine sulfate monohydrate in a 0.05 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) =350/450 nm (Wu and Tanoue 2001).  Four indices were used in this study: (1) maximum intensity (Max I); maximum fluorescence emission intensity with an excitation of 313 nm (Donard et al. 1989); (2) maximum wavelength (Max WL); the wavelength that gives the Intmax (Donard et al. 1989); (3) fluorescence index (FI); the ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm with an excitation of 370 nm (f450/f500) (Battin 1998; McKnight et al. 2001);  (4) %285, calculated from a synchronous spectrum.   %285 = Ex285 / (Ex285 + Ex350 + Ex385 + Ex460) x 100, where Ex285, Ex350, Ex385, Ex460 are the emission intensities at the respective excitation wavelengths (nm) noted in subscript (Lu et al. 2003). Total organic C content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer at 1050 degrees C, hippuric acid as a standard.  To remove carbonate, two to five mg of powered sample was weighed into a silver capsule and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h, followed by drying under vacuum to eliminate any remaining hydrochloric acid (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Then, the capsules were closed for analysis.  Solid state 13C NMR spectra were obtained at a 13C resonance frequency of 50.3 MHz on a Bruker ASX200 NMR spectrometer equipped with a commercial 7 mm cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) probe using a standard CPMAS pulse sequence.  13C chemical shifts are expressed with respect to tetramethylsilane by using the carbonyl carbon of glycine (176.48 ppm) as an external reference.  Other analytical conditions were as follows: rotation frequency, 4.5 kHz; contact time, 1 ms; recycle delay, 2 s; scans accumulated, 3000-20000; spectral width, 25 kHz; filter frequency, 32 kHz; Lorentzian line-broadening, 120 Hz.  NMR spectra were divided into four regions according to chemical shifts as follows: 0-45 ppm (alkyl C), 45-110 ppm (O-alkyl C), 110-160 ppm (aromatic C), 160-210 ppm (carbonyl C) (Kogel-Knabner 1997).  The first order spinning sidebands (SSBs) of aromatic and carbonyl signals (220 and 260 ppm, respectively) were corrected if necessary, according to Knicker and Skjemstad (2000).  Sugar composition analysis was performed according to Amelung et al. (1996).  Briefly, ca. 10 mg of powdered UDOM sample was mixed with an internal standard (50 ug myo-inositol) and 10 ml of 4 mol L-1 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hydrolyzed at 105 degrees C for 4 h.  Following filtration with a pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filter, the solution was rotary-evaporated to remove TFA.  The sample was then reconstituted with 2 ml water and passed through Amberlite XAD-4, and Dowex 50 W X 8 columns, successively.  The sample was freeze-dried, and derivatized with 400 ul bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 75 degrees C for 5 min.  Analysis was performed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 quadrupole mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a JandW DB1MS capillary column.  Quantification was based on the comparison of the area on total ion chromatogram with known concentration of standard materials (arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) that were processed in the same way as the samples.  Initial oven temperature was set at 160 degrees C, held for 0.5 min, ramped at 8 degrees C min-1 to 185 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 191 degrees C, by 0.5 degrees C min-1 to 195 degrees C, and thereafter by 10 degrees C min-1 to 250 degrees C and held for 5 min. Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  Detection limit was around 100 ppm in UDOM.  The TMAH thermochemolysis was performed according to Hatcher et al (1995).  Briefly, 4 to 10 mg C powdered UDOM sample was placed in a 5-ml glass ampoule and 200 ul of solution consisting of 25% TMAH in methanol and 200 ul of an internal standard, n-eicosane (50 ug ml-1 in methanol) were added.  The methanol was evaporated under vacuum, and the ampoule was flame sealed and placed in a gas chromatographic oven at 250 degrees C for 30 min.  After cooling, the ampoule was cracked open, and the inner glass surface was washed with 1 ml of methylene chloride three times, and concentrated to approximately 200 ul under a gentle stream of nitrogen.  Analysis of this extract was performed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a 5973 mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a DB5MS (5% phenyl, 95% methyl silicone; 30 m length,0.25 mm i.d.,0.25 um film thickness) capillary column.  Helium served as the carrier gas.  The column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature at 40 degrees C, ramped at 10 degrees C min-1 to 120 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 200 degrees C, and thereafter by 4 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C (Mannino and Harvey 2000). Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  The detection limit was 1 ng for the eicosane standard.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  A response factor for phenolic compounds to eicosane was calculated by averaging the relative response of methylation products of vanillin, vanillic acid, and acetovanilone to that of the internal standard.  The concentration of phenolic compounds was estimated by comparing the area with that of the eicosane standard.  Py-GC/MS analyses were on UDOM samples.  Briefly, UDOM samples (ca. 5 mg) were pyrolyzed at 650 degrees C for 20 s in a helium atmosphere using a pyroprobe 1500 pyrolyzer.  Separation of pyrolysis products was carried out on a DB5MS fused-silica column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness) at a split ratio of 1:75 under helium atmosphere.  The oven was connected to the split/splitless injection port of a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC coupled to a HP 5973 mass spectrometer.  The oven temperature program was as follows: initial temperature was held at 40 degrees C for 2 min, ramped at 7 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C where it was held for 15 min.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  Other analytical conditions were identical with those of TMAH thermochemolysis described above.  Based on the relative abundance of individually identified pyrolysis products (approximately 100 compounds; peak area of individual compound to total peak area of identified compounds in pyrogram) a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed using an agglomerative method with SPSS version 11.0.1 software for the interpretation of the multivariate pyrolysis data set.</para>

          <para>DOC concentrations were analyzed using a high temperature catalytic combustion method on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 total organic carbon analyzer.  Samples (4 ml) were acidified with 10ul of conc. HCl and sparged for 5 min with nitrogen (150 ml min-1) to remove inorganic carbon.  The mean of three to six injections was reported for each sample.  Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrometer equipped with a 150-W Xenon arc lamp as the light source.  The emission monochromator was scanned from 250 to 550 nm with excitation at 313 and 370 nm (Donard et al. 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994).  Further, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence spectra at a constant offset value between emission and excitation wavelength of 30 nm were measured from 250 to 550 nm (Lu et al. 2003; Jaffe et al. 2004).  Both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm.  Absorbance of the DOM solution was scanned from 250 to 550 nm for the correction of inner-filter effects on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  The inner-filter effects were corrected for all the spectra following the procedure described by McKnight et al. (2001).  Spectra were not corrected for instrumental response.  Milli-Q water was used as a blank to background substract water Raman scatter peaks.  The fluorescence intensities were expressed in quinine sulfate units (QSU); 1 QSU = 1 ug L-1 of quinine sulfate monohydrate in a 0.05 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) =350/450 nm (Wu and Tanoue 2001).  Four indices were used in this study: (1) maximum intensity (Max I); maximum fluorescence emission intensity with an excitation of 313 nm (Donard et al. 1989); (2) maximum wavelength (Max WL); the wavelength that gives the Intmax (Donard et al. 1989); (3) fluorescence index (FI); the ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm with an excitation of 370 nm (f450/f500) (Battin 1998; McKnight et al. 2001);  (4) %285, calculated from a synchronous spectrum.   %285 = Ex285 / (Ex285 + Ex350 + Ex385 + Ex460) x 100, where Ex285, Ex350, Ex385, Ex460 are the emission intensities at the respective excitation wavelengths (nm) noted in subscript (Lu et al. 2003). Total organic C content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer at 1050 degrees C, hippuric acid as a standard.  To remove carbonate, two to five mg of powered sample was weighed into a silver capsule and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h, followed by drying under vacuum to eliminate any remaining hydrochloric acid (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Then, the capsules were closed for analysis.  Solid state 13C NMR spectra were obtained at a 13C resonance frequency of 50.3 MHz on a Bruker ASX200 NMR spectrometer equipped with a commercial 7 mm cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) probe using a standard CPMAS pulse sequence.  13C chemical shifts are expressed with respect to tetramethylsilane by using the carbonyl carbon of glycine (176.48 ppm) as an external reference.  Other analytical conditions were as follows: rotation frequency, 4.5 kHz; contact time, 1 ms; recycle delay, 2 s; scans accumulated, 3000-20000; spectral width, 25 kHz; filter frequency, 32 kHz; Lorentzian line-broadening, 120 Hz.  NMR spectra were divided into four regions according to chemical shifts as follows: 0-45 ppm (alkyl C), 45-110 ppm (O-alkyl C), 110-160 ppm (aromatic C), 160-210 ppm (carbonyl C) (Kogel-Knabner 1997).  The first order spinning sidebands (SSBs) of aromatic and carbonyl signals (220 and 260 ppm, respectively) were corrected if necessary, according to Knicker and Skjemstad (2000).  Sugar composition analysis was performed according to Amelung et al. (1996).  Briefly, ca. 10 mg of powdered UDOM sample was mixed with an internal standard (50 ug myo-inositol) and 10 ml of 4 mol L-1 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hydrolyzed at 105 degrees C for 4 h.  Following filtration with a pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filter, the solution was rotary-evaporated to remove TFA.  The sample was then reconstituted with 2 ml water and passed through Amberlite XAD-4, and Dowex 50 W X 8 columns, successively.  The sample was freeze-dried, and derivatized with 400 ul bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 75 degrees C for 5 min.  Analysis was performed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 quadrupole mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a JandW DB1MS capillary column.  Quantification was based on the comparison of the area on total ion chromatogram with known concentration of standard materials (arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) that were processed in the same way as the samples.  Initial oven temperature was set at 160 degrees C, held for 0.5 min, ramped at 8 degrees C min-1 to 185 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 191 degrees C, by 0.5 degrees C min-1 to 195 degrees C, and thereafter by 10 degrees C min-1 to 250 degrees C and held for 5 min.

          <para>DOC concentrations were analyzed using a high temperature catalytic combustion method on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 total organic carbon analyzer.  Samples (4 ml) were acidified with 10ul of conc. HCl and sparged for 5 min with nitrogen (150 ml min-1) to remove inorganic carbon.  The mean of three to six injections was reported for each sample.  Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrometer equipped with a 150-W Xenon arc lamp as the light source.  The emission monochromator was scanned from 250 to 550 nm with excitation at 313 and 370 nm (Donard et al. 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994).  Further, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence spectra at a constant offset value between emission and excitation wavelength of 30 nm were measured from 250 to 550 nm (Lu et al. 2003; Jaffe et al. 2004).  Both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm.  Absorbance of the DOM solution was scanned from 250 to 550 nm for the correction of inner-filter effects on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  The inner-filter effects were corrected for all the spectra following the procedure described by McKnight et al. (2001).  Spectra were not corrected for instrumental response.  Milli-Q water was used as a blank to background substract water Raman scatter peaks.  The fluorescence intensities were expressed in quinine sulfate units (QSU); 1 QSU = 1 ug L-1 of quinine sulfate monohydrate in a 0.05 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) =350/450 nm (Wu and Tanoue 2001).  Four indices were used in this study: (1) maximum intensity (Max I); maximum fluorescence emission intensity with an excitation of 313 nm (Donard et al. 1989); (2) maximum wavelength (Max WL); the wavelength that gives the Intmax (Donard et al. 1989); (3) fluorescence index (FI); the ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm with an excitation of 370 nm (f450/f500) (Battin 1998; McKnight et al. 2001);  (4) %285, calculated from a synchronous spectrum.   %285 = Ex285 / (Ex285 + Ex350 + Ex385 + Ex460) x 100, where Ex285, Ex350, Ex385, Ex460 are the emission intensities at the respective excitation wavelengths (nm) noted in subscript (Lu et al. 2003). Total organic C content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer at 1050 degrees C, hippuric acid as a standard.  To remove carbonate, two to five mg of powered sample was weighed into a silver capsule and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h, followed by drying under vacuum to eliminate any remaining hydrochloric acid (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Then, the capsules were closed for analysis.  Solid state 13C NMR spectra were obtained at a 13C resonance frequency of 50.3 MHz on a Bruker ASX200 NMR spectrometer equipped with a commercial 7 mm cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) probe using a standard CPMAS pulse sequence.  13C chemical shifts are expressed with respect to tetramethylsilane by using the carbonyl carbon of glycine (176.48 ppm) as an external reference.  Other analytical conditions were as follows: rotation frequency, 4.5 kHz; contact time, 1 ms; recycle delay, 2 s; scans accumulated, 3000-20000; spectral width, 25 kHz; filter frequency, 32 kHz; Lorentzian line-broadening, 120 Hz.  NMR spectra were divided into four regions according to chemical shifts as follows: 0-45 ppm (alkyl C), 45-110 ppm (O-alkyl C), 110-160 ppm (aromatic C), 160-210 ppm (carbonyl C) (Kogel-Knabner 1997).  The first order spinning sidebands (SSBs) of aromatic and carbonyl signals (220 and 260 ppm, respectively) were corrected if necessary, according to Knicker and Skjemstad (2000).  Sugar composition analysis was performed according to Amelung et al. (1996).  Briefly, ca. 10 mg of powdered UDOM sample was mixed with an internal standard (50 ug myo-inositol) and 10 ml of 4 mol L-1 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hydrolyzed at 105 degrees C for 4 h.  Following filtration with a pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filter, the solution was rotary-evaporated to remove TFA.  The sample was then reconstituted with 2 ml water and passed through Amberlite XAD-4, and Dowex 50 W X 8 columns, successively.  The sample was freeze-dried, and derivatized with 400 ul bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 75 degrees C for 5 min.  Analysis was performed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 quadrupole mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a JandW DB1MS capillary column.  Quantification was based on the comparison of the area on total ion chromatogram with known concentration of standard materials (arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) that were processed in the same way as the samples.  Initial oven temperature was set at 160 degrees C, held for 0.5 min, ramped at 8 degrees C min-1 to 185 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 191 degrees C, by 0.5 degrees C min-1 to 195 degrees C, and thereafter by 10 degrees C min-1 to 250 degrees C and held for 5 min. Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  Detection limit was around 100 ppm in UDOM.  The TMAH thermochemolysis was performed according to Hatcher et al (1995).  Briefly, 4 to 10 mg C powdered UDOM sample was placed in a 5-ml glass ampoule and 200 ul of solution consisting of 25% TMAH in methanol and 200 ul of an internal standard, n-eicosane (50 ug ml-1 in methanol) were added.  The methanol was evaporated under vacuum, and the ampoule was flame sealed and placed in a gas chromatographic oven at 250 degrees C for 30 min.  After cooling, the ampoule was cracked open, and the inner glass surface was washed with 1 ml of methylene chloride three times, and concentrated to approximately 200 ul under a gentle stream of nitrogen.  Analysis of this extract was performed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a 5973 mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a DB5MS (5% phenyl, 95% methyl silicone; 30 m length,0.25 mm i.d.,0.25 um film thickness) capillary column.  Helium served as the carrier gas.  The column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature at 40 degrees C, ramped at 10 degrees C min-1 to 120 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 200 degrees C, and thereafter by 4 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C (Mannino and Harvey 2000). Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  The detection limit was 1 ng for the eicosane standard.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  A response factor for phenolic compounds to eicosane was calculated by averaging the relative response of methylation products of vanillin, vanillic acid, and acetovanilone to that of the internal standard.  The concentration of phenolic compounds was estimated by comparing the area with that of the eicosane standard.  Py-GC/MS analyses were on UDOM samples.  Briefly, UDOM samples (ca. 5 mg) were pyrolyzed at 650 degrees C for 20 s in a helium atmosphere using a pyroprobe 1500 pyrolyzer.  Separation of pyrolysis products was carried out on a DB5MS fused-silica column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness) at a split ratio of 1:75 under helium atmosphere.  The oven was connected to the split/splitless injection port of a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC coupled to a HP 5973 mass spectrometer.  The oven temperature program was as follows: initial temperature was held at 40 degrees C for 2 min, ramped at 7 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C where it was held for 15 min.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  Other analytical conditions were identical with those of TMAH thermochemolysis described above.  Based on the relative abundance of individually identified pyrolysis products (approximately 100 compounds; peak area of individual compound to total peak area of identified compounds in pyrogram) a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed using an agglomerative method with SPSS version 11.0.1 software for the interpretation of the multivariate pyrolysis data set.</para>

Quantification was based on the comparison of the area on total ion chromatogram with known concentration of standard materials (arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) that were processed in the same way as the samples.  Initial oven temperature was set at 160 degrees C, held for 0.5 min, ramped at 8 degrees C min-1 to 185 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 191 degrees C, by 0.5 degrees C min-1 to 195 degrees C, and thereafter by 10 degrees C min-1 to 250 degrees C and held for 5 min. Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  Detection limit was around 100 ppm in UDOM.  The TMAH thermochemolysis was performed according to Hatcher et al (1995).  Briefly, 4 to 10 mg C powdered UDOM sample was placed in a 5-ml glass ampoule and 200 ul of solution consisting of 25% TMAH in methanol and 200 ul of an internal standard, n-eicosane (50 ug ml-1 in methanol) were added.  The methanol was evaporated under vacuum, and the ampoule was flame sealed and placed in a gas chromatographic oven at 250 degrees C for 30 min.  After cooling, the ampoule was cracked open, and the inner glass surface was washed with 1 ml of methylene chloride three times, and concentrated to approximately 200 ul under a gentle stream of nitrogen.  Analysis of this extract was performed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a 5973 mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a DB5MS (5% phenyl, 95% methyl silicone; 30 m length,0.25 mm i.d.,0.25 um film thickness) capillary column.  Helium served as the carrier gas.  The column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature at 40 degrees C, ramped at 10 degrees C min-1 to 120 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 200 degrees C, and thereafter by 4 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C (Mannino and Harvey 2000). Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  The detection limit was 1 ng for the eicosane standard.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  A response factor for phenolic compounds to eicosane was calculated by averaging the relative response of methylation products of vanillin, vanillic acid, and acetovanilone to that of the internal standard.  The concentration of phenolic compounds was estimated by comparing the area with that of the eicosane standard.  Py-GC/MS analyses were on UDOM samples.  Briefly, UDOM samples (ca. 5 mg) were pyrolyzed at 650 degrees C for 20 s in a helium atmosphere using a pyroprobe 1500 pyrolyzer.  Separation of pyrolysis products was carried out on a DB5MS fused-silica column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness) at a split ratio of 1:75 under helium atmosphere.  The oven was connected to the split/splitless injection port of a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC coupled to a HP 5973 mass spectrometer.  The oven temperature program was as follows: initial temperature was held at 40 degrees C for 2 min, ramped at 7 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C where it was held for 15 min.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  Other analytical conditions were identical with those of TMAH thermochemolysis described above.  Based on the relative abundance of individually identified pyrolysis products (approximately 100 compounds; peak area of individual compound to total peak area of identified compounds in pyrogram) a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed using an agglomerative method with SPSS version 11.0.1 software for the interpretation of the multivariate pyrolysis data set.</para>

          <para>DOC concentrations were analyzed using a high temperature catalytic combustion method on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 total organic carbon analyzer.  Samples (4 ml) were acidified with 10ul of conc. HCl and sparged for 5 min with nitrogen (150 ml min-1) to remove inorganic carbon.  The mean of three to six injections was reported for each sample.  Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrometer equipped with a 150-W Xenon arc lamp as the light source.  The emission monochromator was scanned from 250 to 550 nm with excitation at 313 and 370 nm (Donard et al. 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994).  Further, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence spectra at a constant offset value between emission and excitation wavelength of 30 nm were measured from 250 to 550 nm (Lu et al. 2003; Jaffe et al. 2004).  Both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm.  Absorbance of the DOM solution was scanned from 250 to 550 nm for the correction of inner-filter effects on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  The inner-filter effects were corrected for all the spectra following the procedure described by McKnight et al. (2001).  Spectra were not corrected for instrumental response.  Milli-Q water was used as a blank to background substract water Raman scatter peaks.  The fluorescence intensities were expressed in quinine sulfate units (QSU); 1 QSU = 1 ug L-1 of quinine sulfate monohydrate in a 0.05 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) =350/450 nm (Wu and Tanoue 2001).  Four indices were used in this study: (1) maximum intensity (Max I); maximum fluorescence emission intensity with an excitation of 313 nm (Donard et al. 1989); (2) maximum wavelength (Max WL); the wavelength that gives the Intmax (Donard et al. 1989); (3) fluorescence index (FI); the ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm with an excitation of 370 nm (f450/f500) (Battin 1998; McKnight et al. 2001);  (4) %285, calculated from a synchronous spectrum.   %285 = Ex285 / (Ex285 + Ex350 + Ex385 + Ex460) x 100, where Ex285, Ex350, Ex385, Ex460 are the emission intensities at the respective excitation wavelengths (nm) noted in subscript (Lu et al. 2003). Total organic C content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer at 1050 degrees C, hippuric acid as a standard.  To remove carbonate, two to five mg of powered sample was weighed into a silver capsule and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h, followed by drying under vacuum to eliminate any remaining hydrochloric acid (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Then, the capsules were closed for analysis.  Solid state 13C NMR spectra were obtained at a 13C resonance frequency of 50.3 MHz on a Bruker ASX200 NMR spectrometer equipped with a commercial 7 mm cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) probe using a standard CPMAS pulse sequence.  13C chemical shifts are expressed with respect to tetramethylsilane by using the carbonyl carbon of glycine (176.48 ppm) as an external reference.  Other analytical conditions were as follows: rotation frequency, 4.5 kHz; contact time, 1 ms; recycle delay, 2 s; scans accumulated, 3000-20000; spectral width, 25 kHz; filter frequency, 32 kHz; Lorentzian line-broadening, 120 Hz.  NMR spectra were divided into four regions according to chemical shifts as follows: 0-45 ppm (alkyl C), 45-110 ppm (O-alkyl C), 110-160 ppm (aromatic C), 160-210 ppm (carbonyl C) (Kogel-Knabner 1997).  The first order spinning sidebands (SSBs) of aromatic and carbonyl signals (220 and 260 ppm, respectively) were corrected if necessary, according to Knicker and Skjemstad (2000).  Sugar composition analysis was performed according to Amelung et al. (1996).  Briefly, ca. 10 mg of powdered UDOM sample was mixed with an internal standard (50 ug myo-inositol) and 10 ml of 4 mol L-1 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hydrolyzed at 105 degrees C for 4 h.  Following filtration with a pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filter, the solution was rotary-evaporated to remove TFA.  The sample was then reconstituted with 2 ml water and passed through Amberlite XAD-4, and Dowex 50 W X 8 columns, successively.  The sample was freeze-dried, and derivatized with 400 ul bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 75 degrees C for 5 min.  Analysis was performed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 quadrupole mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a JandW DB1MS capillary column.  Quantification was based on the comparison of the area on total ion chromatogram with known concentration of standard materials (arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) that were processed in the same way as the samples.

Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  The detection limit was 1 ng for the eicosane standard.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  A response factor for phenolic compounds to eicosane was calculated by averaging the relative response of methylation products of vanillin, vanillic acid, and acetovanilone to that of the internal standard.

          <para>DOC concentrations were analyzed using a high temperature catalytic combustion method on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 total organic carbon analyzer.  Samples (4 ml) were acidified with 10ul of conc. HCl and sparged for 5 min with nitrogen (150 ml min-1) to remove inorganic carbon.  The mean of three to six injections was reported for each sample.  Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrometer equipped with a 150-W Xenon arc lamp as the light source.  The emission monochromator was scanned from 250 to 550 nm with excitation at 313 and 370 nm (Donard et al. 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994).  Further, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence spectra at a constant offset value between emission and excitation wavelength of 30 nm were measured from 250 to 550 nm (Lu et al. 2003; Jaffe et al. 2004).  Both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm.  Absorbance of the DOM solution was scanned from 250 to 550 nm for the correction of inner-filter effects on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  The inner-filter effects were corrected for all the spectra following the procedure described by McKnight et al. (2001).  Spectra were not corrected for instrumental response.  Milli-Q water was used as a blank to background substract water Raman scatter peaks.  The fluorescence intensities were expressed in quinine sulfate units (QSU); 1 QSU = 1 ug L-1 of quinine sulfate monohydrate in a 0.05 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) =350/450 nm (Wu and Tanoue 2001).  Four indices were used in this study: (1) maximum intensity (Max I); maximum fluorescence emission intensity with an excitation of 313 nm (Donard et al. 1989); (2) maximum wavelength (Max WL); the wavelength that gives the Intmax (Donard et al. 1989); (3) fluorescence index (FI); the ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm with an excitation of 370 nm (f450/f500) (Battin 1998; McKnight et al. 2001);  (4) %285, calculated from a synchronous spectrum.   %285 = Ex285 / (Ex285 + Ex350 + Ex385 + Ex460) x 100, where Ex285, Ex350, Ex385, Ex460 are the emission intensities at the respective excitation wavelengths (nm) noted in subscript (Lu et al. 2003). Total organic C content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer at 1050 degrees C, hippuric acid as a standard.  To remove carbonate, two to five mg of powered sample was weighed into a silver capsule and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h, followed by drying under vacuum to eliminate any remaining hydrochloric acid (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Then, the capsules were closed for analysis.  Solid state 13C NMR spectra were obtained at a 13C resonance frequency of 50.3 MHz on a Bruker ASX200 NMR spectrometer equipped with a commercial 7 mm cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) probe using a standard CPMAS pulse sequence.  13C chemical shifts are expressed with respect to tetramethylsilane by using the carbonyl carbon of glycine (176.48 ppm) as an external reference.  Other analytical conditions were as follows: rotation frequency, 4.5 kHz; contact time, 1 ms; recycle delay, 2 s; scans accumulated, 3000-20000; spectral width, 25 kHz; filter frequency, 32 kHz; Lorentzian line-broadening, 120 Hz.  NMR spectra were divided into four regions according to chemical shifts as follows: 0-45 ppm (alkyl C), 45-110 ppm (O-alkyl C), 110-160 ppm (aromatic C), 160-210 ppm (carbonyl C) (Kogel-Knabner 1997).  The first order spinning sidebands (SSBs) of aromatic and carbonyl signals (220 and 260 ppm, respectively) were corrected if necessary, according to Knicker and Skjemstad (2000).  Sugar composition analysis was performed according to Amelung et al. (1996).  Briefly, ca. 10 mg of powdered UDOM sample was mixed with an internal standard (50 ug myo-inositol) and 10 ml of 4 mol L-1 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hydrolyzed at 105 degrees C for 4 h.  Following filtration with a pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filter, the solution was rotary-evaporated to remove TFA.  The sample was then reconstituted with 2 ml water and passed through Amberlite XAD-4, and Dowex 50 W X 8 columns, successively.  The sample was freeze-dried, and derivatized with 400 ul bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 75 degrees C for 5 min.  Analysis was performed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 quadrupole mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a JandW DB1MS capillary column.  Quantification was based on the comparison of the area on total ion chromatogram with known concentration of standard materials (arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) that were processed in the same way as the samples.  Initial oven temperature was set at 160 degrees C, held for 0.5 min, ramped at 8 degrees C min-1 to 185 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 191 degrees C, by 0.5 degrees C min-1 to 195 degrees C, and thereafter by 10 degrees C min-1 to 250 degrees C and held for 5 min. Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  Detection limit was around 100 ppm in UDOM.  The TMAH thermochemolysis was performed according to Hatcher et al (1995).  Briefly, 4 to 10 mg C powdered UDOM sample was placed in a 5-ml glass ampoule and 200 ul of solution consisting of 25% TMAH in methanol and 200 ul of an internal standard, n-eicosane (50 ug ml-1 in methanol) were added.  The methanol was evaporated under vacuum, and the ampoule was flame sealed and placed in a gas chromatographic oven at 250 degrees C for 30 min.  After cooling, the ampoule was cracked open, and the inner glass surface was washed with 1 ml of methylene chloride three times, and concentrated to approximately 200 ul under a gentle stream of nitrogen.  Analysis of this extract was performed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a 5973 mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a DB5MS (5% phenyl, 95% methyl silicone; 30 m length,0.25 mm i.d.,0.25 um film thickness) capillary column.  Helium served as the carrier gas.  The column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature at 40 degrees C, ramped at 10 degrees C min-1 to 120 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 200 degrees C, and thereafter by 4 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C (Mannino and Harvey 2000). Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  The detection limit was 1 ng for the eicosane standard.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  A response factor for phenolic compounds to eicosane was calculated by averaging the relative response of methylation products of vanillin, vanillic acid, and acetovanilone to that of the internal standard.  The concentration of phenolic compounds was estimated by comparing the area with that of the eicosane standard.  Py-GC/MS analyses were on UDOM samples.  Briefly, UDOM samples (ca. 5 mg) were pyrolyzed at 650 degrees C for 20 s in a helium atmosphere using a pyroprobe 1500 pyrolyzer.  Separation of pyrolysis products was carried out on a DB5MS fused-silica column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness) at a split ratio of 1:75 under helium atmosphere.  The oven was connected to the split/splitless injection port of a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC coupled to a HP 5973 mass spectrometer.  The oven temperature program was as follows: initial temperature was held at 40 degrees C for 2 min, ramped at 7 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C where it was held for 15 min.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  Other analytical conditions were identical with those of TMAH thermochemolysis described above.  Based on the relative abundance of individually identified pyrolysis products (approximately 100 compounds; peak area of individual compound to total peak area of identified compounds in pyrogram) a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed using an agglomerative method with SPSS version 11.0.1 software for the interpretation of the multivariate pyrolysis data set.</para>

Initial oven temperature was set at 160 degrees C, held for 0.5 min, ramped at 8 degrees C min-1 to 185 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 191 degrees C, by 0.5 degrees C min-1 to 195 degrees C, and thereafter by 10 degrees C min-1 to 250 degrees C and held for 5 min. Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  Detection limit was around 100 ppm in UDOM.  The TMAH thermochemolysis was performed according to Hatcher et al (1995).  Briefly, 4 to 10 mg C powdered UDOM sample was placed in a 5-ml glass ampoule and 200 ul of solution consisting of 25% TMAH in methanol and 200 ul of an internal standard, n-eicosane (50 ug ml-1 in methanol) were added.  The methanol was evaporated under vacuum, and the ampoule was flame sealed and placed in a gas chromatographic oven at 250 degrees C for 30 min.  After cooling, the ampoule was cracked open, and the inner glass surface was washed with 1 ml of methylene chloride three times, and concentrated to approximately 200 ul under a gentle stream of nitrogen.  Analysis of this extract was performed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a 5973 mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a DB5MS (5% phenyl, 95% methyl silicone; 30 m length,0.25 mm i.d.,0.25 um film thickness) capillary column.  Helium served as the carrier gas.  The column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature at 40 degrees C, ramped at 10 degrees C min-1 to 120 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 200 degrees C, and thereafter by 4 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C (Mannino and Harvey 2000). Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  The detection limit was 1 ng for the eicosane standard.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  A response factor for phenolic compounds to eicosane was calculated by averaging the relative response of methylation products of vanillin, vanillic acid, and acetovanilone to that of the internal standard.  The concentration of phenolic compounds was estimated by comparing the area with that of the eicosane standard.  Py-GC/MS analyses were on UDOM samples.  Briefly, UDOM samples (ca. 5 mg) were pyrolyzed at 650 degrees C for 20 s in a helium atmosphere using a pyroprobe 1500 pyrolyzer.  Separation of pyrolysis products was carried out on a DB5MS fused-silica column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness) at a split ratio of 1:75 under helium atmosphere.  The oven was connected to the split/splitless injection port of a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC coupled to a HP 5973 mass spectrometer.  The oven temperature program was as follows: initial temperature was held at 40 degrees C for 2 min, ramped at 7 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C where it was held for 15 min.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  Other analytical conditions were identical with those of TMAH thermochemolysis described above.  Based on the relative abundance of individually identified pyrolysis products (approximately 100 compounds; peak area of individual compound to total peak area of identified compounds in pyrogram) a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed using an agglomerative method with SPSS version 11.0.1 software for the interpretation of the multivariate pyrolysis data set.</para>

          <para>DOC concentrations were analyzed using a high temperature catalytic combustion method on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 total organic carbon analyzer.  Samples (4 ml) were acidified with 10ul of conc. HCl and sparged for 5 min with nitrogen (150 ml min-1) to remove inorganic carbon.  The mean of three to six injections was reported for each sample.  Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrometer equipped with a 150-W Xenon arc lamp as the light source.  The emission monochromator was scanned from 250 to 550 nm with excitation at 313 and 370 nm (Donard et al. 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994).  Further, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence spectra at a constant offset value between emission and excitation wavelength of 30 nm were measured from 250 to 550 nm (Lu et al. 2003; Jaffe et al. 2004).  Both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm.  Absorbance of the DOM solution was scanned from 250 to 550 nm for the correction of inner-filter effects on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  The inner-filter effects were corrected for all the spectra following the procedure described by McKnight et al. (2001).  Spectra were not corrected for instrumental response.  Milli-Q water was used as a blank to background substract water Raman scatter peaks.  The fluorescence intensities were expressed in quinine sulfate units (QSU); 1 QSU = 1 ug L-1 of quinine sulfate monohydrate in a 0.05 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) =350/450 nm (Wu and Tanoue 2001).  Four indices were used in this study: (1) maximum intensity (Max I); maximum fluorescence emission intensity with an excitation of 313 nm (Donard et al. 1989); (2) maximum wavelength (Max WL); the wavelength that gives the Intmax (Donard et al. 1989); (3) fluorescence index (FI); the ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm with an excitation of 370 nm (f450/f500) (Battin 1998; McKnight et al. 2001);  (4) %285, calculated from a synchronous spectrum.   %285 = Ex285 / (Ex285 + Ex350 + Ex385 + Ex460) x 100, where Ex285, Ex350, Ex385, Ex460 are the emission intensities at the respective excitation wavelengths (nm) noted in subscript (Lu et al. 2003). Total organic C content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer at 1050 degrees C, hippuric acid as a standard.  To remove carbonate, two to five mg of powered sample was weighed into a silver capsule and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h, followed by drying under vacuum to eliminate any remaining hydrochloric acid (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Then, the capsules were closed for analysis.  Solid state 13C NMR spectra were obtained at a 13C resonance frequency of 50.3 MHz on a Bruker ASX200 NMR spectrometer equipped with a commercial 7 mm cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) probe using a standard CPMAS pulse sequence.  13C chemical shifts are expressed with respect to tetramethylsilane by using the carbonyl carbon of glycine (176.48 ppm) as an external reference.  Other analytical conditions were as follows: rotation frequency, 4.5 kHz; contact time, 1 ms; recycle delay, 2 s; scans accumulated, 3000-20000; spectral width, 25 kHz; filter frequency, 32 kHz; Lorentzian line-broadening, 120 Hz.  NMR spectra were divided into four regions according to chemical shifts as follows: 0-45 ppm (alkyl C), 45-110 ppm (O-alkyl C), 110-160 ppm (aromatic C), 160-210 ppm (carbonyl C) (Kogel-Knabner 1997).  The first order spinning sidebands (SSBs) of aromatic and carbonyl signals (220 and 260 ppm, respectively) were corrected if necessary, according to Knicker and Skjemstad (2000).  Sugar composition analysis was performed according to Amelung et al. (1996).  Briefly, ca. 10 mg of powdered UDOM sample was mixed with an internal standard (50 ug myo-inositol) and 10 ml of 4 mol L-1 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hydrolyzed at 105 degrees C for 4 h.  Following filtration with a pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filter, the solution was rotary-evaporated to remove TFA.  The sample was then reconstituted with 2 ml water and passed through Amberlite XAD-4, and Dowex 50 W X 8 columns, successively.  The sample was freeze-dried, and derivatized with 400 ul bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 75 degrees C for 5 min.  Analysis was performed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 quadrupole mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a JandW DB1MS capillary column.  Quantification was based on the comparison of the area on total ion chromatogram with known concentration of standard materials (arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) that were processed in the same way as the samples.  Initial oven temperature was set at 160 degrees C, held for 0.5 min, ramped at 8 degrees C min-1 to 185 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 191 degrees C, by 0.5 degrees C min-1 to 195 degrees C, and thereafter by 10 degrees C min-1 to 250 degrees C and held for 5 min.

          <para>DOC concentrations were analyzed using a high temperature catalytic combustion method on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 total organic carbon analyzer.  Samples (4 ml) were acidified with 10ul of conc. HCl and sparged for 5 min with nitrogen (150 ml min-1) to remove inorganic carbon.  The mean of three to six injections was reported for each sample.  Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrometer equipped with a 150-W Xenon arc lamp as the light source.  The emission monochromator was scanned from 250 to 550 nm with excitation at 313 and 370 nm (Donard et al. 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994).  Further, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence spectra at a constant offset value between emission and excitation wavelength of 30 nm were measured from 250 to 550 nm (Lu et al. 2003; Jaffe et al. 2004).  Both excitation and emission slits were set at 10 nm.  Absorbance of the DOM solution was scanned from 250 to 550 nm for the correction of inner-filter effects on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  The inner-filter effects were corrected for all the spectra following the procedure described by McKnight et al. (2001).  Spectra were not corrected for instrumental response.  Milli-Q water was used as a blank to background substract water Raman scatter peaks.  The fluorescence intensities were expressed in quinine sulfate units (QSU); 1 QSU = 1 ug L-1 of quinine sulfate monohydrate in a 0.05 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) =350/450 nm (Wu and Tanoue 2001).  Four indices were used in this study: (1) maximum intensity (Max I); maximum fluorescence emission intensity with an excitation of 313 nm (Donard et al. 1989); (2) maximum wavelength (Max WL); the wavelength that gives the Intmax (Donard et al. 1989); (3) fluorescence index (FI); the ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm with an excitation of 370 nm (f450/f500) (Battin 1998; McKnight et al. 2001);  (4) %285, calculated from a synchronous spectrum.   %285 = Ex285 / (Ex285 + Ex350 + Ex385 + Ex460) x 100, where Ex285, Ex350, Ex385, Ex460 are the emission intensities at the respective excitation wavelengths (nm) noted in subscript (Lu et al. 2003). Total organic C content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer at 1050 degrees C, hippuric acid as a standard.  To remove carbonate, two to five mg of powered sample was weighed into a silver capsule and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h, followed by drying under vacuum to eliminate any remaining hydrochloric acid (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Then, the capsules were closed for analysis.  Solid state 13C NMR spectra were obtained at a 13C resonance frequency of 50.3 MHz on a Bruker ASX200 NMR spectrometer equipped with a commercial 7 mm cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) probe using a standard CPMAS pulse sequence.  13C chemical shifts are expressed with respect to tetramethylsilane by using the carbonyl carbon of glycine (176.48 ppm) as an external reference.  Other analytical conditions were as follows: rotation frequency, 4.5 kHz; contact time, 1 ms; recycle delay, 2 s; scans accumulated, 3000-20000; spectral width, 25 kHz; filter frequency, 32 kHz; Lorentzian line-broadening, 120 Hz.  NMR spectra were divided into four regions according to chemical shifts as follows: 0-45 ppm (alkyl C), 45-110 ppm (O-alkyl C), 110-160 ppm (aromatic C), 160-210 ppm (carbonyl C) (Kogel-Knabner 1997).  The first order spinning sidebands (SSBs) of aromatic and carbonyl signals (220 and 260 ppm, respectively) were corrected if necessary, according to Knicker and Skjemstad (2000).  Sugar composition analysis was performed according to Amelung et al. (1996).  Briefly, ca. 10 mg of powdered UDOM sample was mixed with an internal standard (50 ug myo-inositol) and 10 ml of 4 mol L-1 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and hydrolyzed at 105 degrees C for 4 h.  Following filtration with a pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filter, the solution was rotary-evaporated to remove TFA.  The sample was then reconstituted with 2 ml water and passed through Amberlite XAD-4, and Dowex 50 W X 8 columns, successively.  The sample was freeze-dried, and derivatized with 400 ul bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) at 75 degrees C for 5 min.  Analysis was performed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 quadrupole mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a JandW DB1MS capillary column.  Quantification was based on the comparison of the area on total ion chromatogram with known concentration of standard materials (arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) that were processed in the same way as the samples.  Initial oven temperature was set at 160 degrees C, held for 0.5 min, ramped at 8 degrees C min-1 to 185 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 191 degrees C, by 0.5 degrees C min-1 to 195 degrees C, and thereafter by 10 degrees C min-1 to 250 degrees C and held for 5 min. Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  Detection limit was around 100 ppm in UDOM.  The TMAH thermochemolysis was performed according to Hatcher et al (1995).  Briefly, 4 to 10 mg C powdered UDOM sample was placed in a 5-ml glass ampoule and 200 ul of solution consisting of 25% TMAH in methanol and 200 ul of an internal standard, n-eicosane (50 ug ml-1 in methanol) were added.  The methanol was evaporated under vacuum, and the ampoule was flame sealed and placed in a gas chromatographic oven at 250 degrees C for 30 min.  After cooling, the ampoule was cracked open, and the inner glass surface was washed with 1 ml of methylene chloride three times, and concentrated to approximately 200 ul under a gentle stream of nitrogen.  Analysis of this extract was performed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC-MS series gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a 5973 mass selective detector.  One ul of the solution was injected into a DB5MS (5% phenyl, 95% methyl silicone; 30 m length,0.25 mm i.d.,0.25 um film thickness) capillary column.  Helium served as the carrier gas.  The column temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature at 40 degrees C, ramped at 10 degrees C min-1 to 120 degrees C, followed by 3 degrees C min-1 to 200 degrees C, and thereafter by 4 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C (Mannino and Harvey 2000). Mass spectra were recorded under electron impact ionisation conditions (70 eV) at 1 scan s-1 in the m/z = 50-500 mass range.  The detection limit was 1 ng for the eicosane standard.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  A response factor for phenolic compounds to eicosane was calculated by averaging the relative response of methylation products of vanillin, vanillic acid, and acetovanilone to that of the internal standard.  The concentration of phenolic compounds was estimated by comparing the area with that of the eicosane standard.  Py-GC/MS analyses were on UDOM samples.  Briefly, UDOM samples (ca. 5 mg) were pyrolyzed at 650 degrees C for 20 s in a helium atmosphere using a pyroprobe 1500 pyrolyzer.  Separation of pyrolysis products was carried out on a DB5MS fused-silica column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 mm film thickness) at a split ratio of 1:75 under helium atmosphere.  The oven was connected to the split/splitless injection port of a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC coupled to a HP 5973 mass spectrometer.  The oven temperature program was as follows: initial temperature was held at 40 degrees C for 2 min, ramped at 7 degrees C min-1 to 300 degrees C where it was held for 15 min.  The assignment of peaks was based on the comparison of mass spectra with the spectral library (NIST 98, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and/or mass spectral interpretation.  Other analytical conditions were identical with those of TMAH thermochemolysis described above.  Based on the relative abundance of individually identified pyrolysis products (approximately 100 compounds; peak area of individual compound to total peak area of identified compounds in pyrogram) a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed using an agglomerative method with SPSS version 11.0.1 software for the interpretation of the multivariate pyrolysis data set.</para>

          <para>Surface water samples were collected in 25-L white low-density polyethylene Carboy bottles during the early part of the dry season (from 05 Dec 2001 to 28 Jan 2002).  The bottles were cleaned by soaking in 0.5 mol L-1 HCl followed by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH for 24 h each. Water samples were filtered through pre-combusted (470 degrees C for 4 hours) 0.7 um GF/F glass fiber filters, followed by concentration using a Pellicon 2 Mini tangential flow ultrafiltration (TFF) system equipped with a nominal 1000 Da molecular weight cut-off regenerated cellulose membrane (Dai et al. 1998).  The water samples were concentrated to 100 ml at an inlet pressure of 10 psi, and an outlet pressure of 8 psi.  For water samples collected from Florida Bay (sites 9-11), diafiltration was conducted as follows: One liter of Milli-Q water (Millipore) was added to the concentrated sample and then re-concentrated to 100 ml. This process was repeated a total of three times.  The concentrated samples were freeze-dried and powdered with an agate mill.  Water samples for fluorescence analysis were collected separately in 30 ml brown polyethylene bottles, stored on ice, and transported to the laboratory.  The water samples were filtered through pre-combusted (470 degrees C for 4 hours) Whatman GF/F glass fiber filters prior to analysis.Surface water samples were collected in 25-L white low-density polyethylene Carboy bottles during the early part of the dry season (from 05 Dec 2001 to 28 Jan 2002).

        <abstract>
          <para>We are investigating how variability in regional climate, freshwater inputs, disturbance, and perturbations affect the coastal Everglades ecosystem. Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para>

            <abstract>
              <para>Coastal ecosystems are being modified at unprecedented rates through interacting
pressures of global climate change and rapid human population growth, impacting natural coastal
resources and the services they provide. Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence
freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences,
coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual &#226;&#128;&#156;upside-down&#226;&#128;&#157; productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.
