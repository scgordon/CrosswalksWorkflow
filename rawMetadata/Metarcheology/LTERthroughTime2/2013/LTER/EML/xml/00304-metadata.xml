    <section>
      <para>Climate models predict that water limited regions around the world will become drier and warmer in the near future, including southwestern North America. We developed a large-scale experimental system that allows testing of the ecosystem impacts of precipitation changes. Four treatments were applied to 1600 m2 plots (40 m &#215; 40 m), each with three replicates in a pi&#241;on pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniper monosperma) ecosystem. These species have extensive root systems, requiring large-scale manipulation to effectively alter soil water availability.  Treatments consisted of: 1) irrigation plots that receive supplemental water additions, 2) drought plots that receive 55% of ambient rainfall, 3) cover-control plots that receive ambient precipitation, but allow determination of treatment infrastructure artifacts, and 4) ambient control plots. Our drought structures effectively reduced soil water potential and volumetric water content compared to the ambient, cover-control, and water addition plots. Drought and cover control plots experienced an average increase in maximum soil and air temperature at ground level of 1-4&#176; C during the growing season compared to ambient plots, and concurrent short-term diurnal increases in maximum air temperature were also observed directly above and below plastic structures. Our drought and irrigation treatments significantly influenced tree predawn water potential, sap-flow, and net photosynthesis, with drought treatment trees exhibiting significant decreases in physiological function compared to ambient and irrigated trees.  Supplemental irrigation resulted in a significant increase in both plant water potential and xylem sap-flow compared to trees in the other treatments. This experimental design effectively allows manipulation of plant water stress at the ecosystem scale, permits a wide range of drought conditions, and provides prolonged drought conditions comparable to historical droughts in the past &#8211; drought events for which wide-spread mortality in both these species was observed.</para>

    <para>
      <literalLayout>For each 1600 m2 plot, all PIED and JUMO trees ( more than 0.5 cm diameter) were surveyed and inventoried in spring 2011.&#160; For each tree, a designation of alive or dead at the time of the 2011 survey was recorded.&#160; Trees that were dead prior to the initiation of the 2006 project (i.e., snags) were excluded from the survey records.&#160; The tree tag number for target trees in each plot is the plot and tree number (example, P1T1).&#160; Non-target trees in each plot were tagged with a random number using a stamped metal tag.&#160; Tree diameter was measured at 30cm stem height and for trees with multiple stems at 30 cm height - a single equivalent diameter was calculated and recorded.&#160; Tree basal area was calculated using stem diameter at 30cm.&#160; Tree sapwood area and tree leaf area were calculated using site specific allometric equations that were developed in 2006 (using stem diameter as the predictor variable).&#160;&#160; Accordingly, tree sapwood area and tree leaf area reflect biometric conditions that existed at the initiation of treatments in 2007.&#160;&#160; Crown diameter was directly measured on all inventoried trees.&#160;&#160; PIED and JUMO comprised the overwhelming majority of the woody canopy cover at this PJ-woodland site.&#160; Accordingly, very little of the total basal area, stem sapwood area, or canopy leaf area was comprised of other woody species at this site (thus, any non-PIED or non-JUMO data is not shown since it comprised an extremely small % of the total woody biomass in these plots.)The treatment classes provided in the file are as follows; ambient (1), drought (2), cover-control (3), and irrigation (4).&#160; The experiment used plot aspect as the blocking factor.&#160;&#160; There are 3 different replicate blocks and block classifications designated in the files; flat aspect (1), north aspect (2), and south aspect (3).&#160; This will be obvious when viewing the files.Tree numbers are always grouped by species as follows (regardless of plot); Trees 1-5 are original Pinus edulis, Trees 6-10 are original Juniper monosperma.&#160;&#160; When one of these original trees died, an additional tree in the plot was added to retain an adequate sample size over time (i.e., multiple years+).&#160;&#160; These additional trees are grouped as follows; Trees 11-15 are &#8220;replacement&#8221; Pinus edulis, Trees 16-20 are &#8220;replacement&#8221; Juniper monosperma.&#160; &#8220;Replacement&#8221; is used here in a more restricted sense, as these additional trees have their separate and unique tree designation number.So, in differing plots you will have differing numbers of target trees depending on; 1) the number of trees for which data was collected, and 2) how many additional &#8220;replacement trees&#8221; had to be designated due to mortality (or partial mortality) of original trees.&#160; Many plots have n=10 trees, based on the original T1-T5 and T6-10 designation, as these particular plots did not experience mortality.&#160;&#160; However, a plot like P10 has a total of n=16 trees.&#160; In P10, the original T1-5 and T6-T10 trees are listed, a replacement Pinon (T11) is listed, and five additional/replacement junipers (T16-T20).&#160;&#160;</literalLayout>

      <geographicCoverage>
        <geographicDescription>Location: Site situated on the eastern flank of Los Pinos Mountains, approx. 3 miles south of NM state route 60, directly adjacent to the eastern boundary of the Sevillets USFWS National Refuge.  Landform: Located at the base of the eastern flank of the Los Pinos Mountains. Slope varies from 0-2% in experimental plots situated in level portions of the site, with steeper grades ranging from 6-18% for plots established on hill-slopes., Soils: Soil texture analysis across the site (both hill-slope and flat/level topography) revealed surface soils that are predominately silt loam with; (1) a transition to
sandy loam texture at depth, and (2) a significant percentage of coarse fragments present both at the soil surface and throughout the profile. Soil depth across the site ranges from 20 to &#8805; 100 cm, with shallower soil depths occurring on hill-slopes where depth to caliche and/or bed-rock is only 20-30 cm in some instances.
, Hydrology: Well drained., Vegetation: The site is a pi&#241;on pine (Pinus edulis, Engelm.) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma (Engelm.) Sarg.) woodland, with several other commonly observed woody shrub species present, notably; Mahonia spp. (algerita), Falugia paradoxa (Apache plume), Quercus turbinella (shrub live oak), and Rhus spp. (sumac). Multiple species of cacti and agave (Cylindropuntia spp., Opuntia spp., and Yucca spp.) are present, along with numerous species of perennial grasses and forbs; including an extensive inter-canopy coverage by grasses of the genus Bouteloua.
, Climate: Climate records (20-yr) from a nearby Sevilleta LTER meteorological station
(Cerro Montoso #42; http://sev.lternet.edu/) indicate a mean annual precipitation total of 362.7 mm/yr. The region is strongly influenced by the North American Monsoon, with a large fraction of annual precipitation occurring in July, August, and September when monsoon circulation is active. Mean annual temperature (20-yr) at this nearby LTER site was 12.78 C, with a mean July maximum of 31.08 C and a mean December minimum of 3.38 C.

              <literalLayout>Experimental Treatment Design (see Pangle et al. 2012 for detailed methodology)To effectively reduce water availability to trees, we installed treatments of sufficient size to minimize tree water uptake from outside of the plot.&#160; Thus, we constructed three replicated drought structures that were 40 m &#215; 40 m (1600 m2). We targeted a 50% reduction in ambient precipitation through water removal troughs that covered ~50% of the land surface area. Drought plot infrastructure was positioned to insure that targeted Pi&#241;on pine and juniper were centrally located within each drought plot to provide the maximum distance between tree stems and the nearest plot boundary.&#160; Each drought and cover-control plot consists of 27 parallel troughs running across the 40 m plot. Each trough was constructed with overlapping 3ft &#215;10 ft (0.91 m &#215; 3.05 m) pieces of thermoplastic polymer sheets (Makloron SL Polycarbonate Sheet, Sheffield Plastics Inc, Sheffield, MA) fixed with self-tapping metal screws to horizontal rails that are approximately waist height and are supported by vertical posts every 2.5-3.5 m. The plastic sheets were bent into a concave shape to collect and divert the precipitation off of the plot. The bending and spacing of the plastic resulted in 0.81 m (32 in) troughs separated by 0.56 m (22 in) walkways.&#160; Individual troughs often intersected the canopy of trees because of their height. The troughs were installed as close to the bole of the tree as possible without damaging branches in order to maximize the area covered by the plastic across the entire plot. An end-cap was attached to the downstream edge of the trough to prevent water from falling onto the base of the tree.&#160; A piece of 3 in (7.62 cm) PVC pipe or suction hose (used when the bole of a tree was directly below trough) was then attached to the downstream side of the end-cap, enabling water to flow into the trough on the other side of a tree. End-caps were also placed at the downhill end of the troughs on the edge of the plot and fitted with 90 degree fittings to divert water down into a 30 cm2 gutter (open on top) that ran perpendicular to the plot. Collected water was then channeled from the gutter into adjacent arroyos for drainage away from the study area. We built cover-control infrastructures to investigate the impact of the plastic drought structures independent of changes in precipitation. This was necessary because of the high radiation environment in central New Mexico, in which the clear plastic troughs can effectively act as a greenhouse structure. The cover-control treatment had the same dimensions as the drought plots with one key difference. The plastic was attached to the rails in a convex orientation so precipitation would fall on top of the plastic and then drain directly down onto the plot. The cover-control plots were designed to receive the same amount of precipitation as un-manipulated ambient plots, with the precipitation falling and draining into the walkways between the rows of troughs. Cover-control plots were constructed between June-21-07 and July-24-07; drought plots were constructed between August-09-07 and August-27-07.&#160; The total plastic coverage in each plot is 45% &#177; 1% of the 1600 m2 plot area due to the variable terrain and canopy cover. Our irrigation system consisted of above-canopy sprinkler nozzles configured to deliver supplemental rainstorm event(s) at a rate of 19 mm hr-1. Our irrigation system is a modified design of the above-canopy irrigation system outlined by Munster et al. (2006). Each of the three irrigation plots has three 2750 gal (10.41 m3) water storage tanks connected in parallel.&#160; These tanks were filled with filtered reverse osmosis (RO) water brought to the site with multiple tractor-trailer trucks. During irrigation events, water is pumped from the tanks through a series of hoses attached to 16 equally-spaced sprinklers within the plot. Each sprinkler is 6.1 m (20 ft) tall (2-3 m higher than mean tree height), and fitted with a sprinkler nozzle that creates an even circular distribution of water with a radius of 5 m on the ground.&#160; The irrigation systems were tested in October 2007 (2 mm supplemental), and full applications (19 mm) were applied in 2008 on 24-June, 15-July, and 26-August. During subsequent years (2009-2012), a total of four to six irrigation events (19mm each) were applied (please contact Will Pockman and/or Robert Pangle for specific application dates and rates).&#160;&#160;</literalLayout>
