      <para>This datalayer is part of a group of layers used for research in the Ipswich River Watershed. This datalayer shows the level of protection for areas that are defined as Protected and Recreational Open Space by MassGIS (www.state.ma.us/mgis). This layer is derived from the Protected and Recreational Open Space layer provided by for each town. The values are from the Level of Protection (lev_prot) field in the data table. To show the what level of protection open space areas in the Ipswich watered are under.</para>

  		<abstract>
  			<para>
  				The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER is an integrated research, education and outreach program whose goal is to develop a predictive 
  				understanding of the long-term response of watershed and estuarine ecosystems at the land-sea interface to changes in climate, land use 
  				and sea level. The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the 
  				adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic 
  				nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external 
  				drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the 
  				spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

  				<geographicCoverage>
  					<geographicDescription>The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, 
  						formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich 
  						(404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston "bedroom" communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a 
  						higher proportion of forest.
