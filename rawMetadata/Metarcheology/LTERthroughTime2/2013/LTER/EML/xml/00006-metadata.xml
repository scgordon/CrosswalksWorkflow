    <abstract>
      <para>A better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients entering Florida Bay is a key issue regarding the restoration of the Everglades.  In addition to precipitation, the other major source of freshwater to Florida Bay is from Taylor Slough and the C-111 Basin in the northeast section of the Bay.  While it is known that these areas deliver significant amounts of N to the Bay, a significant portion of this is in the form of dissolved organic N (DON).  The sources, environmental fate and bioavailability to microorganisms of this DON are however, not known.  Should this DON be readily available, any increased load as a function of restoration changes might have an impact on internal phytoplankton bloom dynamics.  No significant flocculation or precipitation of DOM occurred with increase in salinity, meaning  that terrestrial DOM does not get trapped in the sediments but stays in the water column where it subjected to photolysis and advective transport.  Sunlight has a significant effect on the chemical characteristics of DOM.  While the DOC levels did not change significantly during photo-exposure, the optical characteristics of the DOM were modified.  The environmental implications of this are conflicting: photo-induced polymerization may stabilize the DOM by reducing its bioavailability while photolysis may make the DOM more labile.  Overall, DON bioavailability was relatively low in this region. Even though the amount of DON loaded to the bay may be significant, the fraction of DON available for microbial cycling is much smaller.  The amount of N supplied by recycling may be a significant portion of the total DIN pool.  All this must be considered in context with the proposed CERP modifications to flows.  As of the latest initial Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project (CERP) update, the flows to Taylor Slough and C-111/Panhandle Basis are not predicted to change very much from base conditions.  Therefore we do not expect any great increases in TN loading in this region.  In contrast, the proposed flow increases to the Shark River Slough are large and may have significant effects on transport of DOM to the Southwest Florida Shelf.  We believe that future efforts in DON characterization and bioavailability should be concentrated in this area.  </para>

          <para>Surface water samples were collected in 25 L white low density polyethylene bottles during the early part of the dry season (from 05 Dec 2001 to 28 Jan 2002). The bottles were cleaned beforehand by soaking in 0.5 mol L-1 HCl followed by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH for 24 h each.  Water samples were filtered through pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filters (nominal pore size, 0.7 um) and concentrated (see Maie et al. 2005 for detail).  During ultrafiltration the samples were cooled in iced water. In the case of saline water (TS/Ph10), diafiltration was conducted as follows: one liter of Milli-Q water was added to the concentrated sample and then re-concentrated to 100 mL. This was repeated a total of three times to eliminate salts. The concentrated samples were freeze-dried and powdered with an agate mortar and pestle in preparation for analysis.  UDOM solutions of approximately 5 mgC L-1 were prepared in a 0.05 M Tris (Hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) buffer solution adjusted to pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid. Since the Florida Bay sample (TS/Ph10) exhibited considerably weaker absorbance, it was measured at 20 mgC L-1. After dissolution, all UDOM solutions were filtered through precombusted GF/F filters.  The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank.   Two optical parameters were determined- (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the UV spectral slope (S). The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The S parameter is obtained by fitting the absorption data to a simple exponential equation (Blough and Green, 1995). The S parameter is known to be sensitive to baseline offsets; therefore, to correct for this, the average absorbance from 700 to 800 nm was subtracted from each spectrum (Green and Blough, 1994).  Fluorescence spectra were measured.  As a quick, simple means of distinguishing organic matter source changes, two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm.  For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at 0.5 nm increments at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan the maximum intensity and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (Donard, et al., 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  These two indices have been used to distinguish the DOM derived from marine/microbial and terrestrial/higher plant origin.  Originally, McKnight et al. (2001) introduced the fluorescence index as a ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. However, we noticed that after fully correcting fluorescence intensity values (including instrument bias corrections) there was a shift of emission maximum to longer wavelengths. Thus we modified the fluorescence index and used the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 470 and 520 nm, instead of 450 and 500 nm.  Similar modifications are being considered by McKnight (pers. comm. 2004). Since comparison of FI values among published data was difficult due to inconsistent spectrum correction, in this study, interpretation was conducted based on the comparison within our sample set.  For three dimensional fluorescence spectra, excitation emission matrix (EEM) measurements were collected in a 1 cm quartz cuvette.  Forty emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths between 260 and 455 nm at 5nm intervals.  The emission wavelengths were scanned from fex plus 10 nm to fex plus 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble, 1996; Coble et al., 1993). The individual spectra were concatenated to form a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM).  Carbonates in UDOM samples were removed prior to analyses using acid vapor decarbonation (Hedges and Stern 1984). Briefly, samples were weighed in duplicate (around 2-5 mg) into silver capsules and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h. Acid vapor was removed under vacuum until there was no noticeable acid smell (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Decarbonation of samples before measuring concentration and isotopic ratio of C is necessary and analytical artifacts due to decarbonation on the concentration and stable isotope ratio measurement of N are negligible (Lorrain et al. 2003).  Organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were measured.  C and N stable isotopic analyses were measured. Isotopic ratios are reported in the standard delta notation. Results are presented with respect to the international standards of atmospheric nitrogen (AIR N2) and Vienna Pee Dee belemnite (V-PDB) for carbon. Duplicate measurements were conducted and reproducibility was =/- 1.5ppm for delta15N and +/- 0.2ppm for delta13C on average.  Solid state cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) 15N NMR spectra were obtained using a ramped pulse sequence (Peersen et al 1993; Cook et al., 1996), a rotation frequency of 5.5 kHz, a contact time of 1 ms, and a pulse delay of 200 ms.  Between 1.1 - 4.6 x 105 single scans were accumulated and line broadenings of 50-160 Hz were applied. The chemical shift was referenced to nitromethane scale (= 0 ppm) and was adjusted with 15N-enriched glycine (-347.6 ppm).  XPS-N1s spectra were recorded using Mg K non-monochromatic radiation with an analyzer pass energy of 32 eV, an electric current of 30 mA, and a voltage of 10 kV. A finely powdered sample (ca. 1 mg) was fixed on the surface of a metallic sample block by means of Scotch double-sided nonconducting tape. Spectra were recorded for each visible line with 0.05 eV per step. The time for one scan was set at 298 ms, and between 126-160 scanned data were accumulated.  Amino acid analysis was performed according to Hedges et al (1994). Greater detail can be found in Cowie and Hedges (1992). Briefly, amino acids were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Samples of UDOM were spiked with a mixture of acidic, basic, and neutral nonprotein amino acids (charge-matched recovery standards) and then hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl under N2 for 70 min at 150 degrees C. The hydrolysate mixture was dried, dissolved, filtered, and converted to fluorescent o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatives, which were analyzed on a 15 cm x 4.6-mm-i.d. column (xxxx) operated in reverse-phase mode with 5-m C18 packing. The amino acids reported with this method are referred to as total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA). The precision of this method is approximately 10%. A total of 19 individual amino acids were analyzed, 15 of which were protein amino acids (aspartic acid, Asp; glutamic acid, Glu; serine, Ser; histidine, His; glycine, Gly; threonine, Thr; arginine, Arg; alanine, Ala; tyrosine, Tyr; methionine, Met; valine, Val; phenylalanine; Phe; isoleucine, Ile; leucine, Leu; lysine, Lys) and 4 non-protein amino acids (-alanine (BALA), -aminobutyric acid (GABA), -aminobutyric acid (AABA), and ornithine (Orn)).  A degradation index (DI), which was introduced by Dauwe et al. (1999) to evaluate the diagenetic state of POM by using amino acid composition, was calculated for our UDOM samples.  The concept of DI is that when natural organic matter samples with different diagenetic histories are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) based on their amino acid composition (mol%), the first principal component (PC1) represents the degree of diagenesis, therefore the score plot of PC1 is referred to as the DI.</para>

          <para>Surface water samples were collected in 25 L white low density polyethylene bottles during the early part of the dry season (from 05 Dec 2001 to 28 Jan 2002). The bottles were cleaned beforehand by soaking in 0.5 mol L-1 HCl followed by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH for 24 h each.  Water samples were filtered through pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filters (nominal pore size, 0.7 um) and concentrated (see Maie et al. 2005 for detail).  During ultrafiltration the samples were cooled in iced water. In the case of saline water (TS/Ph10), diafiltration was conducted as follows: one liter of Milli-Q water was added to the concentrated sample and then re-concentrated to 100 mL. This was repeated a total of three times to eliminate salts. The concentrated samples were freeze-dried and powdered with an agate mortar and pestle in preparation for analysis.  UDOM solutions of approximately 5 mgC L-1 were prepared in a 0.05 M Tris (Hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) buffer solution adjusted to pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid. Since the Florida Bay sample (TS/Ph10) exhibited considerably weaker absorbance, it was measured at 20 mgC L-1. After dissolution, all UDOM solutions were filtered through precombusted GF/F filters.  The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank.   Two optical parameters were determined- (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the UV spectral slope (S). The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The S parameter is obtained by fitting the absorption data to a simple exponential equation (Blough and Green, 1995). The S parameter is known to be sensitive to baseline offsets; therefore, to correct for this, the average absorbance from 700 to 800 nm was subtracted from each spectrum (Green and Blough, 1994).  Fluorescence spectra were measured.  As a quick, simple means of distinguishing organic matter source changes, two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm.  For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at 0.5 nm increments at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan the maximum intensity and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (Donard, et al., 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  These two indices have been used to distinguish the DOM derived from marine/microbial and terrestrial/higher plant origin.  Originally, McKnight et al. (2001) introduced the fluorescence index as a ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. However, we noticed that after fully correcting fluorescence intensity values (including instrument bias corrections) there was a shift of emission maximum to longer wavelengths. Thus we modified the fluorescence index and used the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 470 and 520 nm, instead of 450 and 500 nm.  Similar modifications are being considered by McKnight (pers. comm. 2004). Since comparison of FI values among published data was difficult due to inconsistent spectrum correction, in this study, interpretation was conducted based on the comparison within our sample set.  For three dimensional fluorescence spectra, excitation emission matrix (EEM) measurements were collected in a 1 cm quartz cuvette.  Forty emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths between 260 and 455 nm at 5nm intervals.  The emission wavelengths were scanned from fex plus 10 nm to fex plus 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble, 1996; Coble et al., 1993).

(2001) introduced the fluorescence index as a ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. However, we noticed that after fully correcting fluorescence intensity values (including instrument bias corrections) there was a shift of emission maximum to longer wavelengths. Thus we modified the fluorescence index and used the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 470 and 520 nm, instead of 450 and 500 nm.  Similar modifications are being considered by McKnight (pers. comm. 2004). Since comparison of FI values among published data was difficult due to inconsistent spectrum correction, in this study, interpretation was conducted based on the comparison within our sample set.  For three dimensional fluorescence spectra, excitation emission matrix (EEM) measurements were collected in a 1 cm quartz cuvette.  Forty emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths between 260 and 455 nm at 5nm intervals.  The emission wavelengths were scanned from fex plus 10 nm to fex plus 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble, 1996; Coble et al., 1993). The individual spectra were concatenated to form a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM).  Carbonates in UDOM samples were removed prior to analyses using acid vapor decarbonation (Hedges and Stern 1984). Briefly, samples were weighed in duplicate (around 2-5 mg) into silver capsules and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h. Acid vapor was removed under vacuum until there was no noticeable acid smell (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Decarbonation of samples before measuring concentration and isotopic ratio of C is necessary and analytical artifacts due to decarbonation on the concentration and stable isotope ratio measurement of N are negligible (Lorrain et al. 2003).  Organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were measured.  C and N stable isotopic analyses were measured. Isotopic ratios are reported in the standard delta notation. Results are presented with respect to the international standards of atmospheric nitrogen (AIR N2) and Vienna Pee Dee belemnite (V-PDB) for carbon. Duplicate measurements were conducted and reproducibility was =/- 1.5ppm for delta15N and +/- 0.2ppm for delta13C on average.  Solid state cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) 15N NMR spectra were obtained using a ramped pulse sequence (Peersen et al 1993; Cook et al., 1996), a rotation frequency of 5.5 kHz, a contact time of 1 ms, and a pulse delay of 200 ms.  Between 1.1 - 4.6 x 105 single scans were accumulated and line broadenings of 50-160 Hz were applied. The chemical shift was referenced to nitromethane scale (= 0 ppm) and was adjusted with 15N-enriched glycine (-347.6 ppm).  XPS-N1s spectra were recorded using Mg K non-monochromatic radiation with an analyzer pass energy of 32 eV, an electric current of 30 mA, and a voltage of 10 kV. A finely powdered sample (ca. 1 mg) was fixed on the surface of a metallic sample block by means of Scotch double-sided nonconducting tape. Spectra were recorded for each visible line with 0.05 eV per step. The time for one scan was set at 298 ms, and between 126-160 scanned data were accumulated.  Amino acid analysis was performed according to Hedges et al (1994). Greater detail can be found in Cowie and Hedges (1992). Briefly, amino acids were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Samples of UDOM were spiked with a mixture of acidic, basic, and neutral nonprotein amino acids (charge-matched recovery standards) and then hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl under N2 for 70 min at 150 degrees C. The hydrolysate mixture was dried, dissolved, filtered, and converted to fluorescent o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatives, which were analyzed on a 15 cm x 4.6-mm-i.d. column (xxxx) operated in reverse-phase mode with 5-m C18 packing. The amino acids reported with this method are referred to as total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA). The precision of this method is approximately 10%. A total of 19 individual amino acids were analyzed, 15 of which were protein amino acids (aspartic acid, Asp; glutamic acid, Glu; serine, Ser; histidine, His; glycine, Gly; threonine, Thr; arginine, Arg; alanine, Ala; tyrosine, Tyr; methionine, Met; valine, Val; phenylalanine; Phe; isoleucine, Ile; leucine, Leu; lysine, Lys) and 4 non-protein amino acids (-alanine (BALA), -aminobutyric acid (GABA), -aminobutyric acid (AABA), and ornithine (Orn)).  A degradation index (DI), which was introduced by Dauwe et al. (1999) to evaluate the diagenetic state of POM by using amino acid composition, was calculated for our UDOM samples.  The concept of DI is that when natural organic matter samples with different diagenetic histories are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) based on their amino acid composition (mol%), the first principal component (PC1) represents the degree of diagenesis, therefore the score plot of PC1 is referred to as the DI.</para>

          <para>Surface water samples were collected in 25 L white low density polyethylene bottles during the early part of the dry season (from 05 Dec 2001 to 28 Jan 2002). The bottles were cleaned beforehand by soaking in 0.5 mol L-1 HCl followed by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH for 24 h each.  Water samples were filtered through pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filters (nominal pore size, 0.7 um) and concentrated (see Maie et al. 2005 for detail).  During ultrafiltration the samples were cooled in iced water. In the case of saline water (TS/Ph10), diafiltration was conducted as follows: one liter of Milli-Q water was added to the concentrated sample and then re-concentrated to 100 mL. This was repeated a total of three times to eliminate salts. The concentrated samples were freeze-dried and powdered with an agate mortar and pestle in preparation for analysis.  UDOM solutions of approximately 5 mgC L-1 were prepared in a 0.05 M Tris (Hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) buffer solution adjusted to pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid. Since the Florida Bay sample (TS/Ph10) exhibited considerably weaker absorbance, it was measured at 20 mgC L-1. After dissolution, all UDOM solutions were filtered through precombusted GF/F filters.  The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank.   Two optical parameters were determined- (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the UV spectral slope (S). The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The S parameter is obtained by fitting the absorption data to a simple exponential equation (Blough and Green, 1995). The S parameter is known to be sensitive to baseline offsets; therefore, to correct for this, the average absorbance from 700 to 800 nm was subtracted from each spectrum (Green and Blough, 1994).  Fluorescence spectra were measured.  As a quick, simple means of distinguishing organic matter source changes, two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm.  For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at 0.5 nm increments at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan the maximum intensity and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (Donard, et al., 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).

From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  These two indices have been used to distinguish the DOM derived from marine/microbial and terrestrial/higher plant origin.  Originally, McKnight et al. (2001) introduced the fluorescence index as a ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. However, we noticed that after fully correcting fluorescence intensity values (including instrument bias corrections) there was a shift of emission maximum to longer wavelengths. Thus we modified the fluorescence index and used the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 470 and 520 nm, instead of 450 and 500 nm.  Similar modifications are being considered by McKnight (pers. comm. 2004). Since comparison of FI values among published data was difficult due to inconsistent spectrum correction, in this study, interpretation was conducted based on the comparison within our sample set.  For three dimensional fluorescence spectra, excitation emission matrix (EEM) measurements were collected in a 1 cm quartz cuvette.  Forty emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths between 260 and 455 nm at 5nm intervals.  The emission wavelengths were scanned from fex plus 10 nm to fex plus 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble, 1996; Coble et al., 1993). The individual spectra were concatenated to form a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM).  Carbonates in UDOM samples were removed prior to analyses using acid vapor decarbonation (Hedges and Stern 1984). Briefly, samples were weighed in duplicate (around 2-5 mg) into silver capsules and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h. Acid vapor was removed under vacuum until there was no noticeable acid smell (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Decarbonation of samples before measuring concentration and isotopic ratio of C is necessary and analytical artifacts due to decarbonation on the concentration and stable isotope ratio measurement of N are negligible (Lorrain et al. 2003).  Organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were measured.  C and N stable isotopic analyses were measured. Isotopic ratios are reported in the standard delta notation. Results are presented with respect to the international standards of atmospheric nitrogen (AIR N2) and Vienna Pee Dee belemnite (V-PDB) for carbon. Duplicate measurements were conducted and reproducibility was =/- 1.5ppm for delta15N and +/- 0.2ppm for delta13C on average.  Solid state cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) 15N NMR spectra were obtained using a ramped pulse sequence (Peersen et al 1993; Cook et al., 1996), a rotation frequency of 5.5 kHz, a contact time of 1 ms, and a pulse delay of 200 ms.  Between 1.1 - 4.6 x 105 single scans were accumulated and line broadenings of 50-160 Hz were applied. The chemical shift was referenced to nitromethane scale (= 0 ppm) and was adjusted with 15N-enriched glycine (-347.6 ppm).  XPS-N1s spectra were recorded using Mg K non-monochromatic radiation with an analyzer pass energy of 32 eV, an electric current of 30 mA, and a voltage of 10 kV. A finely powdered sample (ca. 1 mg) was fixed on the surface of a metallic sample block by means of Scotch double-sided nonconducting tape. Spectra were recorded for each visible line with 0.05 eV per step. The time for one scan was set at 298 ms, and between 126-160 scanned data were accumulated.  Amino acid analysis was performed according to Hedges et al (1994). Greater detail can be found in Cowie and Hedges (1992). Briefly, amino acids were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Samples of UDOM were spiked with a mixture of acidic, basic, and neutral nonprotein amino acids (charge-matched recovery standards) and then hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl under N2 for 70 min at 150 degrees C. The hydrolysate mixture was dried, dissolved, filtered, and converted to fluorescent o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatives, which were analyzed on a 15 cm x 4.6-mm-i.d. column (xxxx) operated in reverse-phase mode with 5-m C18 packing. The amino acids reported with this method are referred to as total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA). The precision of this method is approximately 10%. A total of 19 individual amino acids were analyzed, 15 of which were protein amino acids (aspartic acid, Asp; glutamic acid, Glu; serine, Ser; histidine, His; glycine, Gly; threonine, Thr; arginine, Arg; alanine, Ala; tyrosine, Tyr; methionine, Met; valine, Val; phenylalanine; Phe; isoleucine, Ile; leucine, Leu; lysine, Lys) and 4 non-protein amino acids (-alanine (BALA), -aminobutyric acid (GABA), -aminobutyric acid (AABA), and ornithine (Orn)).  A degradation index (DI), which was introduced by Dauwe et al. (1999) to evaluate the diagenetic state of POM by using amino acid composition, was calculated for our UDOM samples.  The concept of DI is that when natural organic matter samples with different diagenetic histories are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) based on their amino acid composition (mol%), the first principal component (PC1) represents the degree of diagenesis, therefore the score plot of PC1 is referred to as the DI.</para>

          <para>Surface water samples were collected in 25 L white low density polyethylene bottles during the early part of the dry season (from 05 Dec 2001 to 28 Jan 2002). The bottles were cleaned beforehand by soaking in 0.5 mol L-1 HCl followed by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH for 24 h each.  Water samples were filtered through pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filters (nominal pore size, 0.7 um) and concentrated (see Maie et al. 2005 for detail).  During ultrafiltration the samples were cooled in iced water. In the case of saline water (TS/Ph10), diafiltration was conducted as follows: one liter of Milli-Q water was added to the concentrated sample and then re-concentrated to 100 mL. This was repeated a total of three times to eliminate salts. The concentrated samples were freeze-dried and powdered with an agate mortar and pestle in preparation for analysis.  UDOM solutions of approximately 5 mgC L-1 were prepared in a 0.05 M Tris (Hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) buffer solution adjusted to pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid. Since the Florida Bay sample (TS/Ph10) exhibited considerably weaker absorbance, it was measured at 20 mgC L-1. After dissolution, all UDOM solutions were filtered through precombusted GF/F filters.  The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank.   Two optical parameters were determined- (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the UV spectral slope (S). The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The S parameter is obtained by fitting the absorption data to a simple exponential equation (Blough and Green, 1995). The S parameter is known to be sensitive to baseline offsets; therefore, to correct for this, the average absorbance from 700 to 800 nm was subtracted from each spectrum (Green and Blough, 1994).  Fluorescence spectra were measured.  As a quick, simple means of distinguishing organic matter source changes, two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm.  For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at 0.5 nm increments at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths.

For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at 0.5 nm increments at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan the maximum intensity and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (Donard, et al., 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  These two indices have been used to distinguish the DOM derived from marine/microbial and terrestrial/higher plant origin.  Originally, McKnight et al. (2001) introduced the fluorescence index as a ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. However, we noticed that after fully correcting fluorescence intensity values (including instrument bias corrections) there was a shift of emission maximum to longer wavelengths. Thus we modified the fluorescence index and used the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 470 and 520 nm, instead of 450 and 500 nm.  Similar modifications are being considered by McKnight (pers. comm. 2004). Since comparison of FI values among published data was difficult due to inconsistent spectrum correction, in this study, interpretation was conducted based on the comparison within our sample set.  For three dimensional fluorescence spectra, excitation emission matrix (EEM) measurements were collected in a 1 cm quartz cuvette.  Forty emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths between 260 and 455 nm at 5nm intervals.  The emission wavelengths were scanned from fex plus 10 nm to fex plus 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble, 1996; Coble et al., 1993). The individual spectra were concatenated to form a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM).  Carbonates in UDOM samples were removed prior to analyses using acid vapor decarbonation (Hedges and Stern 1984). Briefly, samples were weighed in duplicate (around 2-5 mg) into silver capsules and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h. Acid vapor was removed under vacuum until there was no noticeable acid smell (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Decarbonation of samples before measuring concentration and isotopic ratio of C is necessary and analytical artifacts due to decarbonation on the concentration and stable isotope ratio measurement of N are negligible (Lorrain et al. 2003).  Organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were measured.  C and N stable isotopic analyses were measured. Isotopic ratios are reported in the standard delta notation. Results are presented with respect to the international standards of atmospheric nitrogen (AIR N2) and Vienna Pee Dee belemnite (V-PDB) for carbon. Duplicate measurements were conducted and reproducibility was =/- 1.5ppm for delta15N and +/- 0.2ppm for delta13C on average.  Solid state cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) 15N NMR spectra were obtained using a ramped pulse sequence (Peersen et al 1993; Cook et al., 1996), a rotation frequency of 5.5 kHz, a contact time of 1 ms, and a pulse delay of 200 ms.  Between 1.1 - 4.6 x 105 single scans were accumulated and line broadenings of 50-160 Hz were applied. The chemical shift was referenced to nitromethane scale (= 0 ppm) and was adjusted with 15N-enriched glycine (-347.6 ppm).  XPS-N1s spectra were recorded using Mg K non-monochromatic radiation with an analyzer pass energy of 32 eV, an electric current of 30 mA, and a voltage of 10 kV. A finely powdered sample (ca. 1 mg) was fixed on the surface of a metallic sample block by means of Scotch double-sided nonconducting tape. Spectra were recorded for each visible line with 0.05 eV per step. The time for one scan was set at 298 ms, and between 126-160 scanned data were accumulated.  Amino acid analysis was performed according to Hedges et al (1994). Greater detail can be found in Cowie and Hedges (1992). Briefly, amino acids were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Samples of UDOM were spiked with a mixture of acidic, basic, and neutral nonprotein amino acids (charge-matched recovery standards) and then hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl under N2 for 70 min at 150 degrees C. The hydrolysate mixture was dried, dissolved, filtered, and converted to fluorescent o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatives, which were analyzed on a 15 cm x 4.6-mm-i.d. column (xxxx) operated in reverse-phase mode with 5-m C18 packing. The amino acids reported with this method are referred to as total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA). The precision of this method is approximately 10%. A total of 19 individual amino acids were analyzed, 15 of which were protein amino acids (aspartic acid, Asp; glutamic acid, Glu; serine, Ser; histidine, His; glycine, Gly; threonine, Thr; arginine, Arg; alanine, Ala; tyrosine, Tyr; methionine, Met; valine, Val; phenylalanine; Phe; isoleucine, Ile; leucine, Leu; lysine, Lys) and 4 non-protein amino acids (-alanine (BALA), -aminobutyric acid (GABA), -aminobutyric acid (AABA), and ornithine (Orn)).  A degradation index (DI), which was introduced by Dauwe et al. (1999) to evaluate the diagenetic state of POM by using amino acid composition, was calculated for our UDOM samples.  The concept of DI is that when natural organic matter samples with different diagenetic histories are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) based on their amino acid composition (mol%), the first principal component (PC1) represents the degree of diagenesis, therefore the score plot of PC1 is referred to as the DI.</para>

          <para>Surface water samples were collected in 25 L white low density polyethylene bottles during the early part of the dry season (from 05 Dec 2001 to 28 Jan 2002). The bottles were cleaned beforehand by soaking in 0.5 mol L-1 HCl followed by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH for 24 h each.  Water samples were filtered through pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filters (nominal pore size, 0.7 um) and concentrated (see Maie et al. 2005 for detail).  During ultrafiltration the samples were cooled in iced water. In the case of saline water (TS/Ph10), diafiltration was conducted as follows: one liter of Milli-Q water was added to the concentrated sample and then re-concentrated to 100 mL. This was repeated a total of three times to eliminate salts. The concentrated samples were freeze-dried and powdered with an agate mortar and pestle in preparation for analysis.  UDOM solutions of approximately 5 mgC L-1 were prepared in a 0.05 M Tris (Hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) buffer solution adjusted to pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid. Since the Florida Bay sample (TS/Ph10) exhibited considerably weaker absorbance, it was measured at 20 mgC L-1. After dissolution, all UDOM solutions were filtered through precombusted GF/F filters.  The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank.   Two optical parameters were determined- (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the UV spectral slope (S). The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The S parameter is obtained by fitting the absorption data to a simple exponential equation (Blough and Green, 1995). The S parameter is known to be sensitive to baseline offsets; therefore, to correct for this, the average absorbance from 700 to 800 nm was subtracted from each spectrum (Green and Blough, 1994).  Fluorescence spectra were measured.  As a quick, simple means of distinguishing organic matter source changes, two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm.

As a quick, simple means of distinguishing organic matter source changes, two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm.  For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at 0.5 nm increments at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan the maximum intensity and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (Donard, et al., 1989; De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  These two indices have been used to distinguish the DOM derived from marine/microbial and terrestrial/higher plant origin.  Originally, McKnight et al. (2001) introduced the fluorescence index as a ratio of emission intensities at 450 and 500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. However, we noticed that after fully correcting fluorescence intensity values (including instrument bias corrections) there was a shift of emission maximum to longer wavelengths. Thus we modified the fluorescence index and used the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 470 and 520 nm, instead of 450 and 500 nm.  Similar modifications are being considered by McKnight (pers. comm. 2004). Since comparison of FI values among published data was difficult due to inconsistent spectrum correction, in this study, interpretation was conducted based on the comparison within our sample set.  For three dimensional fluorescence spectra, excitation emission matrix (EEM) measurements were collected in a 1 cm quartz cuvette.  Forty emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths between 260 and 455 nm at 5nm intervals.  The emission wavelengths were scanned from fex plus 10 nm to fex plus 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble, 1996; Coble et al., 1993). The individual spectra were concatenated to form a three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM).  Carbonates in UDOM samples were removed prior to analyses using acid vapor decarbonation (Hedges and Stern 1984). Briefly, samples were weighed in duplicate (around 2-5 mg) into silver capsules and exposed to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 h. Acid vapor was removed under vacuum until there was no noticeable acid smell (Hedges and Stern 1984).  Decarbonation of samples before measuring concentration and isotopic ratio of C is necessary and analytical artifacts due to decarbonation on the concentration and stable isotope ratio measurement of N are negligible (Lorrain et al. 2003).  Organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were measured.  C and N stable isotopic analyses were measured. Isotopic ratios are reported in the standard delta notation. Results are presented with respect to the international standards of atmospheric nitrogen (AIR N2) and Vienna Pee Dee belemnite (V-PDB) for carbon. Duplicate measurements were conducted and reproducibility was =/- 1.5ppm for delta15N and +/- 0.2ppm for delta13C on average.  Solid state cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) 15N NMR spectra were obtained using a ramped pulse sequence (Peersen et al 1993; Cook et al., 1996), a rotation frequency of 5.5 kHz, a contact time of 1 ms, and a pulse delay of 200 ms.  Between 1.1 - 4.6 x 105 single scans were accumulated and line broadenings of 50-160 Hz were applied. The chemical shift was referenced to nitromethane scale (= 0 ppm) and was adjusted with 15N-enriched glycine (-347.6 ppm).  XPS-N1s spectra were recorded using Mg K non-monochromatic radiation with an analyzer pass energy of 32 eV, an electric current of 30 mA, and a voltage of 10 kV. A finely powdered sample (ca. 1 mg) was fixed on the surface of a metallic sample block by means of Scotch double-sided nonconducting tape. Spectra were recorded for each visible line with 0.05 eV per step. The time for one scan was set at 298 ms, and between 126-160 scanned data were accumulated.  Amino acid analysis was performed according to Hedges et al (1994). Greater detail can be found in Cowie and Hedges (1992). Briefly, amino acids were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Samples of UDOM were spiked with a mixture of acidic, basic, and neutral nonprotein amino acids (charge-matched recovery standards) and then hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl under N2 for 70 min at 150 degrees C. The hydrolysate mixture was dried, dissolved, filtered, and converted to fluorescent o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatives, which were analyzed on a 15 cm x 4.6-mm-i.d. column (xxxx) operated in reverse-phase mode with 5-m C18 packing. The amino acids reported with this method are referred to as total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA). The precision of this method is approximately 10%. A total of 19 individual amino acids were analyzed, 15 of which were protein amino acids (aspartic acid, Asp; glutamic acid, Glu; serine, Ser; histidine, His; glycine, Gly; threonine, Thr; arginine, Arg; alanine, Ala; tyrosine, Tyr; methionine, Met; valine, Val; phenylalanine; Phe; isoleucine, Ile; leucine, Leu; lysine, Lys) and 4 non-protein amino acids (-alanine (BALA), -aminobutyric acid (GABA), -aminobutyric acid (AABA), and ornithine (Orn)).  A degradation index (DI), which was introduced by Dauwe et al. (1999) to evaluate the diagenetic state of POM by using amino acid composition, was calculated for our UDOM samples.  The concept of DI is that when natural organic matter samples with different diagenetic histories are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) based on their amino acid composition (mol%), the first principal component (PC1) represents the degree of diagenesis, therefore the score plot of PC1 is referred to as the DI.</para>

          <para>Surface water samples were collected in 25 L white low density polyethylene bottles during the early part of the dry season (from 05 Dec 2001 to 28 Jan 2002). The bottles were cleaned beforehand by soaking in 0.5 mol L-1 HCl followed by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH for 24 h each.  Water samples were filtered through pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filters (nominal pore size, 0.7 um) and concentrated (see Maie et al. 2005 for detail).  During ultrafiltration the samples were cooled in iced water. In the case of saline water (TS/Ph10), diafiltration was conducted as follows: one liter of Milli-Q water was added to the concentrated sample and then re-concentrated to 100 mL. This was repeated a total of three times to eliminate salts. The concentrated samples were freeze-dried and powdered with an agate mortar and pestle in preparation for analysis.  UDOM solutions of approximately 5 mgC L-1 were prepared in a 0.05 M Tris (Hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) buffer solution adjusted to pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid. Since the Florida Bay sample (TS/Ph10) exhibited considerably weaker absorbance, it was measured at 20 mgC L-1. After dissolution, all UDOM solutions were filtered through precombusted GF/F filters.  The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank.   Two optical parameters were determined- (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the UV spectral slope (S). The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The S parameter is obtained by fitting the absorption data to a simple exponential equation (Blough and Green, 1995). The S parameter is known to be sensitive to baseline offsets; therefore, to correct for this, the average absorbance from 700 to 800 nm was subtracted from each spectrum (Green and Blough, 1994).

          <para>The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay.  The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6a) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu).  The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/).  Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape.  Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum.  </para>

          <para>Data was processed using Excel (ver. 11 Microsoft) and SigmaPlot (ver.7 SPSS Inc.).All the fluorescence spectra were acquired in ratio mode whereby the sample and reference signals are collected and the ratio is calculated.  Several post-acquisition steps were involved in the correction of the fluorescence spectra. First, an inner filter correction was applied to the fluorescence data according to McKnight et al. (2001).  After inner filter corrections, the sample EEM underwent spectral subtraction of the buffer solution to remove most of the effects due to Raman scattering. Corrections for instrument bias related to wavelength dependent efficiencies of the specific instrument's optical components (gratings, mirrors, etc) were then made by applying multiplication factors, supplied by the manufacturer, for both excitation and emission wavelengths for the range of observations. Finally, fluorescence intensity was converted to quinine sulfate unit (QSU) to facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons (Coble et al., 1993). For X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, correction of binding energy was made relative to the C-C/C-H signal at 385.0 eV in the C1s spectra measured simultaneously. The spectra were deconvoluted into three major N species depending on its binding energy (solid lines), by applying three Gaussian curves with peak centers at 399.0 plus or minus 0.1 eV (aromatic N including imine, pyridine, aromatic amine, and NH in guanidine), 400.4 plus or minus 0.1 eV (peptide bond N including other amides, pyrrole, secondary and tertiary amines, and imide); and 402.3 plus or minus 0.1 eV (primary amine N including protonated amine; Abe and Watanabe, 2004). The proportions of three N groups in total N were estimated from the relative areas surrounded by Gaussian curves and base line with respect to the spectral area.</para>

        <abstract>
          <para>We are investigating how variability in regional climate, freshwater inputs, disturbance, and perturbations affect the coastal Everglades ecosystem. Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para>

          <abstract>
            <para>A better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients entering Florida Bay is a key issue regarding the restoration of the Everglades.  In addition to precipitation, the other major source of freshwater to Florida Bay is from Taylor Slough and the C-111 Basin in the northeast section of the Bay.  While it is known that these areas deliver significant amounts of N to the Bay, a significant portion of this is in the form of dissolved organic N (DON).  The sources, environmental fate and bioavailability to microorganisms of this DON are however, not known.  Should this DON be readily available, any increased load as a function of restoration changes might have an impact on internal phytoplankton bloom dynamics.  No significant flocculation or precipitation of DOM occurred with increase in salinity, meaning  that terrestrial DOM does not get trapped in the sediments but stays in the water column where it subjected to photolysis and advective transport.  Sunlight has a significant effect on the chemical characteristics of DOM.  While the DOC levels did not change significantly during photo-exposure, the optical characteristics of the DOM were modified.  The environmental implications of this are conflicting: photo-induced polymerization may stabilize the DOM by reducing its bioavailability while photolysis may make the DOM more labile.  Overall, DON bioavailability was relatively low in this region. Even though the amount of DON loaded to the bay may be significant, the fraction of DON available for microbial cycling is much smaller.  The amount of N supplied by recycling may be a significant portion of the total DIN pool.  All this must be considered in context with the proposed CERP modifications to flows.  As of the latest initial Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project (CERP) update, the flows to Taylor Slough and C-111/Panhandle Basis are not predicted to change very much from base conditions.  Therefore we do not expect any great increases in TN loading in this region.  In contrast, the proposed flow increases to the Shark River Slough are large and may have significant effects on transport of DOM to the Southwest Florida Shelf.  We believe that future efforts in DON characterization and bioavailability should be concentrated in this area.  </para>
