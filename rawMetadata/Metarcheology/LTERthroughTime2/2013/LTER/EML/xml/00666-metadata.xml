    <abstract>
      <para>Water samples are collected at the end of the dry and the wet season from all LTER sites and stored on ice until return to the lab. They are pre-filtered through pre-combusted GF/F filters and ultrafiltered and concentrated with a Pellicon 2 Mini tangential flow ultrafiltration system.Concentrated samples were then analyzed using fluorescence and SEC-HPLC. This CDOM optical study revealed the presence of two classes of compounds associated with the protein-like peak (peak T; excitation/emission (Ex/Em) maxima at around 280 nm/325 nm), which have very different chemical structures and ecological roles.  In addition to proteins, we propose phenolic compounds as possible origins of peak T in coastal and wetland environments.  In this study, natural water samples were obtained from subtropical rivers and estuarine environments within the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) ecosystem. The samples were ultra-filtered and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEMs) were obtained. The EEMs showed the presence of four peaks with Ex/Em maxima at around 280 nm/325 nm (T), less than 260 nm/460 nm (A), 300 nm/412nm (M), and 350 nm/470 nm (C).  To better understand the nature of peak T, the components originating this peak were separated using size exclusion chromatography  (SEC) and detected by fluorescence emission at Ex/Em = 280 nm/325 nm.  The elution curves revealed the presence of two elution peaks at a molecular weight of greater than 50K (void volume; T1) and around 7.6K (T2).  This result suggested the need of cautious interpretation in the use of peak T as a proxy for the detection of proteinaceous materials in wetland and estuarine environments, since significant amounts of potentially interfering phenolic compounds are leached from senescent biomass in wetland and coastal ecosystems.  As such EEM spectra of gallic acid an important component of hydrolysable tannins, and condensed tannins extracted from red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) showed the presence of a peak maxima at a similar position to peak T (260/346 and 275/313 nm, respectively), suggesting these phenolic compounds can be possible sources of peak T.</para>

          <para>Natural water samples (16 to 50 L) were collected in Nalgene low density polyethylene carboys at the end of the dry (Mar-Apr) and the wet (Sep-Oct) season of 2002 and 2003 from all LTER sites. They were stored on ice and filtered through pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filters upon arrival to the lab. The filtrate was processed through a tangential flow ultrafiltration system (TFF) equipped with 0.2um nominal molecular weight cutoff regenerated cellulose membranes, followed by a concentration with 1kDalton molecular weight cutoff membrane while samples were kept in iced water. Following the concentration procedure, the samples were diafiltered three times with 1-L of Milli-Q Water to eliminate salts. The concentrated UDOM samples were then freeze-dried and stored at room temperature in a dessicator. Before fluorescence or SEC-HPLC analysis, samples were re-hydrated with 0.05M Tris(hydroxymethl)aminomethane (THAM) (adjusted to pH at 7.0 with phosphoric acid) to a concentration of 20 mgCL-1 for Florida Bay samples (TS/Ph 9,10,and 11) and 5 mgCL-1 for all other samples.A series of emission fluorescence spectra of the samples were obtained at a ratio mode (emission signal-to-excitation lamp output) from lamda +10nm to lamda + 250nm at 1nm intervals, where lamda is the excitation wavelength. The excitation wavelength was scanned from 260 to 455 nm every 5 nm in a 1 cm quartz fluorescence cell at room temperature (20 degrees C). Fluorescence values were corrected for internal absorbance quenching following the procedures outlined in McKnight et al (2001). The Fluorescence spectra were also corrected for the internal instrument configuration using excitation and emission correction factors for the range of observations supplied by the manufacturer (e.g. Coble 1996; Kowalczuk et al. 2003). Fluorescence was reported as quinine sulfate units according to Maie et al. (2005). MilliQ-water was measured as the blank and subtracted from the sample spectra. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured with a UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer using a 1 cm quartz cell. The molecular weight distribution of the UDOM was determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Maie et al. 2004; Scully et al. 2004). Analytical conditions were as follows: column, YMC-Pack Diol-120G (pore size 12 nm, I.D. 8.0mm x length 500mm), eluent, 0.05 M THAM (adjusted to pH at 7.0 with phosphoric acid); flow rate, 0.7 ml min-1; detection, fluorescence emission at 325 nm with an excitation at 280nm; injection volume, 200ul; temperature 22 degrees C. The void volume (VO; 13.8 min.) and void volume plus inner volume (VO+VI; 32.3 min.) were determined using Blue Dextran 2000 and tryptophan, respectively. The column was calibrated with several different dextran standards of know molecular weight. Total organic C and N content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer. Prior to analysis trace amounts of carbonate were removed by exposing the powered UDOM in a silver capsule to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 hours (Hedges and Stern 1984). The samples were then dried under vacuum to eliminate any residual hydrochloric acid and sealed for later analysis.</para>

          <para>Natural water samples (16 to 50 L) were collected in Nalgene low density polyethylene carboys at the end of the dry (Mar-Apr) and the wet (Sep-Oct) season of 2002 and 2003 from all LTER sites. They were stored on ice and filtered through pre-combusted GF/F glass fiber filters upon arrival to the lab. The filtrate was processed through a tangential flow ultrafiltration system (TFF) equipped with 0.2um nominal molecular weight cutoff regenerated cellulose membranes, followed by a concentration with 1kDalton molecular weight cutoff membrane while samples were kept in iced water. Following the concentration procedure, the samples were diafiltered three times with 1-L of Milli-Q Water to eliminate salts. The concentrated UDOM samples were then freeze-dried and stored at room temperature in a dessicator. Before fluorescence or SEC-HPLC analysis, samples were re-hydrated with 0.05M Tris(hydroxymethl)aminomethane (THAM) (adjusted to pH at 7.0 with phosphoric acid) to a concentration of 20 mgCL-1 for Florida Bay samples (TS/Ph 9,10,and 11) and 5 mgCL-1 for all other samples.A series of emission fluorescence spectra of the samples were obtained at a ratio mode (emission signal-to-excitation lamp output) from lamda +10nm to lamda + 250nm at 1nm intervals, where lamda is the excitation wavelength. The excitation wavelength was scanned from 260 to 455 nm every 5 nm in a 1 cm quartz fluorescence cell at room temperature (20 degrees C). Fluorescence values were corrected for internal absorbance quenching following the procedures outlined in McKnight et al (2001). The Fluorescence spectra were also corrected for the internal instrument configuration using excitation and emission correction factors for the range of observations supplied by the manufacturer (e.g. Coble 1996; Kowalczuk et al. 2003). Fluorescence was reported as quinine sulfate units according to Maie et al. (2005). MilliQ-water was measured as the blank and subtracted from the sample spectra. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured with a UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer using a 1 cm quartz cell. The molecular weight distribution of the UDOM was determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Maie et al. 2004; Scully et al. 2004). Analytical conditions were as follows: column, YMC-Pack Diol-120G (pore size 12 nm, I.D. 8.0mm x length 500mm), eluent, 0.05 M THAM (adjusted to pH at 7.0 with phosphoric acid); flow rate, 0.7 ml min-1; detection, fluorescence emission at 325 nm with an excitation at 280nm; injection volume, 200ul; temperature 22 degrees C. The void volume (VO; 13.8 min.) and void volume plus inner volume (VO+VI; 32.3 min.) were determined using Blue Dextran 2000 and tryptophan, respectively. The column was calibrated with several different dextran standards of know molecular weight. Total organic C and N content was measured on a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer. Prior to analysis trace amounts of carbonate were removed by exposing the powered UDOM in a silver capsule to hydrochloric acid vapor for 4 hours (Hedges and Stern 1984). The samples were then dried under vacuum to eliminate any residual hydrochloric acid and sealed for later analysis.</para>

          <para>Fluorescence measurements are corrected for internal absorbance quenching (McKnight et al., 2001). Fluorescence spectra are corrected for internal instrument configuration using excitation and emission correction factors (Coble, 1996 and Kowalczuk et al., 2003). SEC-HPLC results were corrected by calibrating the column with several different dextran standards of known molecular weight.</para>

        <abstract>
          <para>We are investigating how variability in regional climate, freshwater inputs, disturbance, and perturbations affect the coastal Everglades ecosystem. Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para>
