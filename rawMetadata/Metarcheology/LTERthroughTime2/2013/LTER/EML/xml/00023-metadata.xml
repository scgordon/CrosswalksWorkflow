    <abstract>
      <para>Plant biomass was collected from Taylor Slough, Shark River and Florida Bay in Everglades National Park. Samples were taken to the lab and incubated with Milli-Q water in the dark for a period of 36 days. NaN3 was added to half the bottles to test the role of microbial activity on the leaching rates and composition of leachate. Every three days the water was decanted and replaced with fresh Milli-Q water. The decanted samples were filtered and analyzed for DOC concentration, sugar content, and total phenol content.</para>

          <para>Ten grams of biomass sample (20 g of periphyton) were placed into 250-ml Nalgene brown bottles.  The bottles were filled with 200-250 ml of Milli-Q water and incubated in the dark.  Milli-Q water was used as the extractant to avoid (1) post-leaching processing of DOM such as complexation/precipitation and oxidation/polymerization, which affect the quantitative analyses of leachate, and (2) contamination of natural water UDOM in biomass leached UDOM.  Furthermore, polyphenols especially leached from mangrove leaves are unstable under high salinity conditions (unpublished data); we therefore used Milli-Q water to investigate the potential leaching amount of DOC from biomass.  To unify the experimental conditions, seagrass was also immersed into Milli-Q water.  We added 1 mg ml-1 of NaN3 as a bacteriostat to half of the bottles (referred as to w/ NaN3, and w/o NaN3 treatments, respectively) to test the role of microbial activity on the leaching rates and composition of leachate.  The incubations ran for 36 days, and every three days, the water was decanted from each bottle and replaced with fresh Milli-Q water (w/ or w/o NaN3).  The decanted samples were first filtered through pre-combusted (470 degrees C for 4h) GF-F glass fiber filters (nominal pore size, 0.7 um), and then through a 0.22 um Durapore membrane filter.  Water samples decanted from the periphyton treatments were centrifuged to remove suspended solids at 3,000 rpm for 10 min before filtration.  The precipitation obtained by centrifugation was returned to the sample bottle.  The filtered water samples were stored at 4 degrees C for no more than 1 week before analyses. The DOC content of the water samples was analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer after acidifying the sample (pH less than 2) with HCl and purging with N2 gas for 5 min.  Although some mangrove leachate produced a fine particulate upon acidification, probably due to aggregation of polyphenols, they were uniformly dispersed through purging with N2 gas, and the average of standard deviation (SD) of measurements was less than 3%. The sugar content of the water samples was analyzed colorimetrically using the Phenol-Sulfuric Acid Method (Dubois et al. 1956; Liu et al. 1973).  Briefly, 1 ml of water sample and 1 ml of 5% phenol aqueous solution (w/v) was pipetted into a test tube, and then 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added.  After mixing vigorously with a vortex mixer, the solution was shaken on a reciprocating shaker for 30 min and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer.  Glucose solutions, of concentrations ranging from 4 to 40 mg C L-1, were used as calibration standards.  The detection limit of this method (absorption = 0.01) was around 0.4 mg C L-1 with a 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette. Total phenol content was measured colorimetrically using Folin-Denis Method (Waterman &amp; Mole 1994).  Briefly, a 0.2-3.4 ml aliquot of water sample was pipetted into a test tube and the volume was increased to 3.4 ml by adding Milli-Q water if necessary.  Then 0.2 ml of Folin-Denis reagent and 0.4 ml of saturated sodium carbonate solution were added in sequence.  After standing for 30 min, the absorbance at 760 nm was measured on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  Tannic acid solutions, of concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 mg C L-1, were used as calibration standards. The detection limit of this method (absorbance = 0.01) was around 0.25 mg C L-1 with a 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette. </para>

          <para>Ten grams of biomass sample (20 g of periphyton) were placed into 250-ml Nalgene brown bottles.  The bottles were filled with 200-250 ml of Milli-Q water and incubated in the dark.  Milli-Q water was used as the extractant to avoid (1) post-leaching processing of DOM such as complexation/precipitation and oxidation/polymerization, which affect the quantitative analyses of leachate, and (2) contamination of natural water UDOM in biomass leached UDOM.  Furthermore, polyphenols especially leached from mangrove leaves are unstable under high salinity conditions (unpublished data); we therefore used Milli-Q water to investigate the potential leaching amount of DOC from biomass.  To unify the experimental conditions, seagrass was also immersed into Milli-Q water.  We added 1 mg ml-1 of NaN3 as a bacteriostat to half of the bottles (referred as to w/ NaN3, and w/o NaN3 treatments, respectively) to test the role of microbial activity on the leaching rates and composition of leachate.  The incubations ran for 36 days, and every three days, the water was decanted from each bottle and replaced with fresh Milli-Q water (w/ or w/o NaN3).  The decanted samples were first filtered through pre-combusted (470 degrees C for 4h) GF-F glass fiber filters (nominal pore size, 0.7 um), and then through a 0.22 um Durapore membrane filter.  Water samples decanted from the periphyton treatments were centrifuged to remove suspended solids at 3,000 rpm for 10 min before filtration.  The precipitation obtained by centrifugation was returned to the sample bottle.  The filtered water samples were stored at 4 degrees C for no more than 1 week before analyses. The DOC content of the water samples was analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer after acidifying the sample (pH less than 2) with HCl and purging with N2 gas for 5 min.  Although some mangrove leachate produced a fine particulate upon acidification, probably due to aggregation of polyphenols, they were uniformly dispersed through purging with N2 gas, and the average of standard deviation (SD) of measurements was less than 3%. The sugar content of the water samples was analyzed colorimetrically using the Phenol-Sulfuric Acid Method (Dubois et al. 1956; Liu et al. 1973).  Briefly, 1 ml of water sample and 1 ml of 5% phenol aqueous solution (w/v) was pipetted into a test tube, and then 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added.  After mixing vigorously with a vortex mixer, the solution was shaken on a reciprocating shaker for 30 min and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer.  Glucose solutions, of concentrations ranging from 4 to 40 mg C L-1, were used as calibration standards.  The detection limit of this method (absorption = 0.01) was around 0.4 mg C L-1 with a 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette. Total phenol content was measured colorimetrically using Folin-Denis Method (Waterman &amp; Mole 1994).  Briefly, a 0.2-3.4 ml aliquot of water sample was pipetted into a test tube and the volume was increased to 3.4 ml by adding Milli-Q water if necessary.  Then 0.2 ml of Folin-Denis reagent and 0.4 ml of saturated sodium carbonate solution were added in sequence.  After standing for 30 min, the absorbance at 760 nm was measured on a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV-visible spectrophotometer.  Tannic acid solutions, of concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 mg C L-1, were used as calibration standards. The detection limit of this method (absorbance = 0.01) was around 0.25 mg C L-1 with a 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette. </para>

          <para>Senescent yellow leaves of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) were handpicked from trees along the mangrove fringe of Northeast Florida Bay (TS/Ph7b = 25 degrees 19 minutes N, -80 degrees 64 minutes W).  Senescent above-ground plant biomass samples of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), spikerush (Eleocharis cellulosa), cattail (Typha domingensis), and both dry and wet periphyton mats were collected from a freshwater prairie in ENP (TS/Ph2 = 25 degrees 40 minutes N, -80 degrees 61 minutes W).  Both dry and wet periphyton mats were investigated in this experiment because dry periphyton, which is formed in the slough during the dry season, is considered to contribute DOM when it is rewetted in the beginning of the rainy season, while wet periphyton from high hydroperiod areas produce DOM throughout the entire season.  Seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) was collected from Florida Bay (TS/Ph10 = 25 degrees 02 minutes N, -80 degrees 68 minutes W).  Sawgrass, spikerush, and cattail sheaths and blades were cut into fragments about 8 cm in length, while dried periphyton samples were passed through a 5-mm mesh sieve to minimize the variation in the quality between replicates.  Mangrove leaves and wet periphyton were used without any pretreatment.  Seagrass blades were used after a gentle rinsing with Milli-Q water.</para>

        <abstract>
          <para>We are investigating how variability in regional climate, freshwater inputs, disturbance, and perturbations affect the coastal Everglades ecosystem. Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para>

          <abstract>
            <para>Our FCE I research focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacts with a marine source of phosphorus (P), the limiting nutrient, to control estuarine productivity where these two influences meet-in the oligohaline ecotone. This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these "upside-down" estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is:  In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.  Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

            <abstract>
              <para>Coastal ecosystems are being modified at unprecedented rates through interacting
pressures of global climate change and rapid human population growth, impacting natural coastal
resources and the services they provide. Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence
freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences,
coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual &#226;&#128;&#156;upside-down&#226;&#128;&#157; productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.
