      <para> Design and hypotheses. The treatments are designed to
 distinguish the effects of plant biomass per se from those of
 plant functional groups and plant species richness within
 functional groups. We recorded the mass of plants removed from
 the plots when the treatments were imposed in 1995; the total
 biomass removed from a plot is an index of the disturbance
 associated with the start of the experiment. One hypothesis is
 that plant biomass, rather than the species or functional group
 composition of the plants, is the critical regulator of
 ecosystem function. If so, most response variables would be
 highly correlated with initial biomass removed in the early
 seasons of the experiment. If remaining species increase in
 biomass over time, to the point where all treatments support
 approximately equal biomass, that correlation (and the
 differences among treatments) should disappear.
 Another hypothesis is that the architecture and physiology
 of different groups of plants differ sufficiently that each
 functional group contributes in a unique way to ecosystem
 function. We therefore are testing the impact of removing
 various groups or growth forms from the plant community. Four
 treatments involve the removal of all individuals of all species
 of a given functional group of perennial plants: shrubs,
 subshrubs, perennial grasses, and succulents (both leaf and stem
 succulents). That is, one treatment involves the removal of
 all shrubs from a plot; another the removal of all perennial
 grasses, and so on. All other treatments (Control plus three
 other treatments) contain at least some species representative
 of all functional groups, so the contrast between the functional
 group removals and these other treatments should reflect the
 effect of functional group diversity.
 There are multiple species in each of the functional groups,
 so an additional hypothesis is that higher species richness
 within a functional group alters ecosystem function significantly.
 We have imposed a Simplified treatment, where only a single
 species (the most abundant species at the time of initiation) of
 each of the four groups remains, and all other species of those
 functional groups have been removed. That is, the Simplified
 plots contain a single shrub (Larrea tridentata), a single
 subshrub (Zinnia acerosa), a single succulent (Yucca baccata),
 and a single perennial grass (Muhlenbergia porteri).
 In contrast, we have also imposed two versions of a Reduced
 diversity treatment, where the dominant species have been removed
 and the subordinate species remain. (In one version of this
 treatment, Larrea is assumed to be the dominant shrub and was
 removed; in another version, Prosopis is assumed to be dominant
 and is removed. In both of these, the dominants of other growth
 forms are as identified above in the Simplified treatment.)
 Finally, in the Control, all species (dominant and subordinate)
 of all four functional groups remain. Hence the contrast among
 the Control, the Reduced, and the Simplified treatments should
 reflect the importance of species richness within functional
 groups.
 Response variables: The vegetation transects are measured
 once or twice a year to assess the response of the plant
 community to the manipulations of species and functional
 diversity. (Measurements are every fall at a minimum. When
 resources permit and vegetation seems to deserve it, spring
 sampling will also be carried out (2 x per year)</para>

      <literalLayout> The Plant Diversity Experiment: The experimental area is a
 250 m x 250 m area located on the NMSU Chihuahuan Desert
 Rangeland Research Center, immediately northeast of the
 intersection of the Summerford powerline road and the road
 running along the southern boundary of the Jornada Experimental
 Range and the CDRRC. The area was gridded into 25 m x 25 m
 plots; because of some existing environmental gradients (the
 area slopes to the east, and mesquite abundance varies from
 north to south) blocks were established and treatments were
 randomly assigned to plots within blocks. A 15 m x 15 m study
 plot with a 5 m buffer area around it was established within
 each 25 m x 25 m plot.
 Plots are oriented north-south with the west side paralleling
 the powerline road. There are 3 parallel, 1 m x 15 m transects per plot.
 Each transect is divided into 15 1-m2 quadrats. The southwest corner
 of Transect 1 begins at the southwest corner of the 15 m x 15 m
 study plot and extends north. The southwest corner of Transect 2
 begins 5 meters from the southwest corner of Transect 1 along the
 south boundary of the 15 m x 15 m plot and extends north. The
 southwest corner of Transect 3 begins 10 meters from the southwest
 corner of Transect 1 along the south boundary of the 15 m x 15 m plot
 and also extends north. The transects run perpendicular to the bajada
 slope.</literalLayout>

      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout> Three 1 m x 15 m transects (total area 45 m2) cross
 each 15 m x 15 m central area in the plots: one at the western-
 most edge of each area, one 5 m to the east, and the third 10 m
 to the east of the western boundary. These transects are
 sampled by the use of meter sticks to frame individual quadrats
 (numbered 1-15 within each transect; the transects are numbered
 1 to 3, from west to east in each plot). All plants rooted within
 the quadrat (or with more than half of the stem or basal area
 rooted within) are measured for maximum diameter, maximum
 perpendicular diameter, and height (all to nearest cm). The
 entire plant canopy is measured, not just that portion falling
 within the quadrat. Plants rooted outside the quadrat, whose
 canopies may overlap the quadrat, are not measured. Multiple
 individuals of the same dimensions in a single quadrat are
 given a "count" (if no count recorded, count = 1). Dead plants
 are identified as to species (where possible) and recorded as
 "condition = dead." High densities of fluffgrass in fall 1997
 forced us to alter sampling, such that DAPU was measured only in
 odd-numbered quadrats for most of the transects. The following
 applies to readings of DAPU (fluffgrass): In Spring 97 all quads
 read for DAPU). Beginning with Fall 97 only odd numbered quads
 measured for DAPU. In Spring and Fall 99 DAPU and all forbs were
 read in only odd numbered quads. In Spring and Fall 2000 DAPU was
 read in odd numbered quads (forbs were read in all quads). In Spring
 2001 DAPU and all forbs were read in odd numbered quads. In Fall
 2001, all vegetation in every quad was read. In Spring 2002 all
 vegetation in all quads was read.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha
