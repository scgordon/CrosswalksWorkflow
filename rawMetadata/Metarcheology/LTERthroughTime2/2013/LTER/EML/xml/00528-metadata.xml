    <section>
      <para> Objectives. Desertification is hypothesized to have
 altered the spatial and temporal availability of resources
 required by the biota. Results of desertification on the
 Jornada include changes to shrub dominated communities and
 major soil changes. We hypothesize that these shifts in
 vegetation have changed resources temporally for many of the
 consumers. If grassland systems respond to rainfall without
 significant lags, but shrub systems do not, then consumer
 species should reflect these differences. In addition,
 shifts from grassland to shrubland results in greater
 structural heterogeneity of the habitats. We have
 hypothesized that consumer populations, diversity, and
 densities of some consumers will be higher in grasslands
 than in shrublands. Diversity and/or densities are
 hypothesized to be related to the NPP of the sites. Data
 will be collected for the duration of the LTER program in
 order to provide data to test these hypotheses.
 Data for arthropods captured in pitfall traps on LTER
 III consumer plots at 2 month intervals. Data includes
 order, family, genus, species, and number.</para>

      <literalLayout> Jornada LTER III arthropod pitfalls are located at each of
 the NPP study sites, excluding the 3 playas.
 (T-WEST, T-EAST, T-TAYL, M-NORT, M-RABB, M-WELL,
 G-IBPE, G-BASN, G-SUMM, C-SAND, C-CALI, C-GRAV)

 The following list gives the location for the line of traps
 for each site relative to the NPP grid:
 C-GRAV NW corner
 C-SAND south side
 C-CALI SW corner
 G-SUMM NE corner
 G-BASN east side
 G-IBPE NW corner
 M-WELL east side
 M-RABB west wide
 M-NORT south side
 T-TAYL east side
 T-EAST east side
 T-WEST south side
 In addition, there were 12 additional pitfalls at G-IBPE and
 C-SAND which were used in a cross-site study for comparison
 to data from the Sevilleta dn Bandelier. These extra
 pitfalls were in 4 sets of 3, distributed on all sides of the
 NPP grid (see maps). Each trap was numbered for
 identification, and these numbers are written on the
 underside of the tile over each trap. The 12 additional
 cross-site study pitfall traps were terminated in March 1997.</literalLayout>

      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

Please send 1 copy of any publication that cites Jornada Basin LTER data to:

            <literalLayout> Arthropod pitfalls were established in January of 1995
 at the start of LTER III; this design is significantly
 different from the pitfalls of LTER II, when lizards and
 arthropods were collected in the same traps. The new
 arthropod pitfalls consist of a small tin can (buried flush
 with the soil surface) in which a plastic cup (10 oz.) fits
 snugly. The cup is filled (about 3/4 full) with propylene
 glycol (the "non-toxic" antifreeze, Sierra brand) which
 captures and preserves any arthropods that stumble in. A
 ceramic tile shades the trap, supported by 4 nails sticking
 about 1" above the ground.
 To minimize rodent damage to the pitfalls, chicken wire
 fences with lids were installed around each trap.
 Unfortunately, rodents or lizards smaller than the holes in
 the chicken wire continued to cause significant damage to
 the traps after the exclosures were added, so in June 1996,
 hardware cloth collars were also added to the pitfalls.
 These collars are squares about 10" on a side with a hole
 cut in the center for the can and cup combination. Additional
 holes were cut for any grass clumps surrounding the pitfalls
 to minimize disturbance to the vegetation. They are buried
 under a thin layer of soil.
 Because of concern about the numbers of vertebrates
 (small rodents and lizards) being caught in the pitfalls, in
 February 1996, 1/4" hardware cloth ladders (5 " long x 3/4 "
 wide) were added to the traps. It is hoped that rodents and
 lizards will be able to escape, while arthropods won't (due
 to the strength of the surface tension of propylene glycol).
 The traps are continuously open, and the arthropods in
 them collected every 2 months. If time permits, the month
 in between collections, the traps should be checked once, to
 top off the propylene glycol, and repair any
 wind/rain/rodent/coyote/vandal damage. During windy
 seasons, the traps at M-RABB and M-NORT may need to be
 collected monthly because of large volumes of sand
 collecting in the cups. Collect these sites monthly if cups
 become close to 1/2 full of sand in one month's time. Data
 may be lost if the cups are allowed to fill completely with
 sand.
 There are five arthropod pitfalls at each of the NPP
 study sites, excluding the playas. The five traps are in a
 line, 15m from each other, marked with orange pin flags.
 The following list tells where the line of traps for each
 site is, relative to the NPP grid: C-GRAV=NW corner, C-
 SAND=south side, C-CALI=SW corner, G-SUMM=NE corner, G-
 BASN=east side, G-IBPE=NW corner, M-WELL=east side, M-
 RABB=west side, M-NORT=south side, T-TAYL=east side, T-
 EAST=east side, T-WEST=south side. In addition, from
 January 1995 to March 1997, at G-IBPE and C-SAND, there were
 12 extra pitfalls, used in a cross-site study for comparison
 to data from the Sevilleta and Bandelier. These extra
 pitfalls were in 4 sets of 3, distributed on all sides of
 the NPP grid (see maps). Each trap was numbered for
 identification, and these numbers were written on the
 underside of the tile over each trap.
 Beginning 08/19/1998 data is being collected of the condition
 of each pitfall trap, whether a sample was collected, and the
 number of vials collected per trap.

 COLLECTION CODES:

 Maintenance Equipment
 trowel
 propylene glycol (Sierra brand antifreeze)
 spare tiles, nails, cups, cans and ladders

 Collection Equipment
 maintenance equipment (above)
 75% alcohol (3 liters + squirt bottle)
 collection vials with labels (see sample labels at end of
 Procedures)
 tweezers, chopstick, fork
 strainers (5)
 funnel
 Ziploc bags (pint size or smaller)

 Maintenance Procedure
 1. Lift tile off each trap and check that soil is flush
 with cup edge. If rodents, wind, water, etc. have pulled
 soil away, replace it. Gravel and rocks can be used to
 discourage digging and "pave" the area around the cup.
 (This "paving" is what we tried before installing the
 hardware cloth collars; hopefully, we won't have to deal
 with much more of this sort of damage.)

 2. Top off the propylene glycol (if necessary) so cup is
 about 3/4 full.

 3. Keep a record of all traps requiring attention.


 Collection Procedure
 1. Remove cup from trap, and dump into strainer placed over
 spare tin can and cup combination. Thoroughly rinse the
 pitfall cup with alcohol from squirt bottle; use fork and
 forceps as necessary to clean out cup.

 2. Return strained propylene glycol to cup, top off as
 necessary, and replace in trap. Do trap maintenance as
 needed (record all damage to traps).

 3. Use funnel to transfer sample to collection vial.***
 Knock strainer firmly against funnel to get tiny -- more than
 microscopic things off strainer into funnel. Chopstick
 works well to push arthropods through neck of funnel with
 small to medium sized collections. If there's more than
 will fit into one collection vial, use forceps to pack large
 insects into vials first, then squeeze the rest in around
 them. (Make sure to add a label to any extra vials used.)
 Rinse funnel with alcohol into vial, and top off vial with
 alcohol as necessary.

 *** The collection kit set up by D. Lightfoot has enough
 strainers to go into a site (except C-SAND and G-IBPE),
 collect all 5 traps, and come out and do the transferring to
 vials back at the truck. Make sure to keep the strainers in
 order so you know which trap they came from, and use the
 bungie cords to hold them in place while carrying the kit.

 4. The strainers should be knocked soundly against
 something solid (e.g. a truck tire) to get any remaining
 mites etc. off them before using them at the next site. The
 funnel, forceps, chopstick, and fork should be rinsed will
 with alcohol before use at a different site.

 Special Procedure for Sandy Traps at M-RABB and M-NORT:
 Save all sand that accumulates in cups. If volume of
 sand (not arthropods) would require more than 1 vial, use
 a ziploc to save the sand. First decant off any free-
 floating arthropods in propylene glycol (and place in
 vial as above), then transfer the sand into a ziploc
 (with a label). Sand will have absorbed plenty of
 propylene glycol, so no alcohol or propylene glycol needs
 to be added to the sand for preservation.

 Laser jet printer ink is not alcohol soluble and works well
 for these labels. If additional labels are needed in the
 field, write (in pencil--many other inks are alcohol soluble)
 the pitfall number (include the site!) and collection date
 onto a small square of the heavy bond paper kept in the
 drawer of the collection kit. You only need enough
 information on the extra labels to match them up with the
 complete labels when the samples are processed.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha 
                         Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State 
                         University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is 
                         administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER 
                         Network, one of  more than 25 long term sites funded by the U.S. National Science 
                         Foundation.</literalLayout>
