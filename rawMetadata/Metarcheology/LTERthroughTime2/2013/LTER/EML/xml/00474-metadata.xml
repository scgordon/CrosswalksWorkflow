      <para> Sum of dry mass removed for each plant growth form from each
 plot of biodiversity experiment.
 Amount of plant material removed in initial establishment of
 plant diversity treatments was recorded for later use as covariate
 or measure of disturbance. Material was weighed in the field by
 species, and species-level data are available from Huenneke;
 however, this file summarizes plant material removed (dry mass)
 by growth form (shrub, subshrub, perennial grass, succulent)
 and by total live dry mass. Also provided are mass of dead
 material collected from plots (same species as live material
 removed for each treatment) and total dry mass, live plus dead.</para>

      <literalLayout> The experimental area is a 250 m x 250 m area located on the NMSU
 Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center, immediately northeast
 of the intersection of the Summerford powerline road and the road
 running along the southern boundary of the Jornada Experimental
 Range and the CDRRC. The area was gridded into 25 m x 25 m plots;
 because of some existing environmental gradients (the area slopes
 to the east, and mesquite abundance varies from north to south)
 blocks were established and treatments were randomly assigned to
 plots within blocks. Plot boundaries are marked with rebar in the
 corners and simple steel wire stretched along boundaries; plots are
 identified by number and treatment on aluminum tags and on plastic
 rebar caps in the southwest corner.</literalLayout>

      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout> Treatments were randomly assigned to plots within each of 6
 blocks in the experimental area (blocking to allow for spatial
 heterogeneity in environment and vegetation). There are 6
 replicates of each of the 8 treatments. We identified perennial
 woody, succulent, and grass species as belonging to a particular
 growth form: shrub, subshrub, grass, or succulent. The treatments
 imposed on a plot involved the following removal of species:

 growth form removals:
 S Shrub Removal = all shrubs removed (Larrea, Prosopis,
 Ephedra, etc.)
 Ss Subshrub Removal = all subshrubs removed (Zinnia,
 Xanthocephalum, etc.)
 PG Perennial Grass Removal = all perennial grasses removed
 (Muhlenbergia, Dasychloa, Setaria, etc.)
 Succ Succulent Removal = all leaf and stem succulents removed
 (Yucca, Opuntia, etc.)

 modifications of species richness within growth forms:
 Simp Simplified Only a single species (the dominant) of
 each growth form remaining, all
 subordinate species removed; plot
 contains only LATR, ZIAC, MUPO, and
 YUBA as woody or grass perennials.
 RedL Reduced minus Larrea Dominant of each growth form
 removed, only subordinates remain;
 Larrea removed as dominant shrub.
 RedP Reduced minus Prosopis Dominant of each growth form
 removed, only subordinates remain;
 Prosopis removed as dominant shrub
 C Control All species of all growth forms remain.

 For any species to be removed from a plot, each individual
 rooted in the plot (or that portion of an individual entering the
 plot from outside) was cut at ground level, minimizing soil
 disturbance where possible. Aboveground portions were weighed in
 the field (fresh weight) with a dairy scale; conversions of data from
 English units to g were done in the lab. Plant material for each
 species from the first 10 plots was brought back to the lab for
 drying (oven temperature 45 C) to constant mass. Ratio of dry mass
 to fresh mass was used to calculate dry mass for all other fresh
 weight measurements. Where a species was encountered in a later
 plot, for which there had been no collection and calculation of
 dry/fresh ratio, we applied the ratio from a species of similar
 growth form and phenology.
 Dead material of shrubs and subshrubs removed from a
 plot was picked up and weighed (assumed to be dry so no
 oven-drying). Dead material that was part of a live plant was
 not separated from the plant and was included in the live mass
 weight. Dead material was identified as that lying on the
 ground or a rooted plant that was completely dead.
 Dry mass of each species was summed for each plot; then
 species' masses were summed by growth form for each plot.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha 
                         Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State 
                         University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is 
                         administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER
