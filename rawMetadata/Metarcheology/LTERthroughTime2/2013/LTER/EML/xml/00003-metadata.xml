    <abstract>
      <para>Dissolved organic matter plays an important role in biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments such as elemental cycling, microbial loop energetics, and the transport of materials across landscapes.  Since most of N (&gt; 90%) and P (around 90%) is in the organic form in the oligotrophic subtropical Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE), study of the source and dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ecosystem is crucial for the better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.  FCE are composed of estuaries with distinct regions with different biogeochemical processes. Freshwater marsh primarily receives terrestrial input and local autochthonous vegetation production. Mangrove ecotone, nevertheless, is affected by the tidal contributions from Florida Bay and local mangrove production. Florida Bay (FB) is a wedge-shaped shallow oligotrophic estuary which lays south of the Everglades, the bottom of which is covered with a dense biomass of seagrass.  The sources of both freshwater and nutrients in FCE are difficult to quantify, owing to the non-point source nature of runoff from the Everglades and the dendritic cross channels in the mangroves.  Furthermore, the combination of multiple DOM sources (freshwater marsh vegetation, mangroves, phytoplankton, seagrass, etc.), and the potential seasonal variability of their relative contribution, along with the history of (photo)chemical and microbial diagenetic processing, and complex advective circulation, makes the study of DOM dynamics in FCE particularly difficult using standard schemes of estuarine ecology.  Quantitative information of DOM is very useful to investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DOM to a certain degree, however, qualitative information is necessary to better understand the source and dynamics of DOM.  Since fluorescence spectroscopic techniques are very sensitive, quick and simple, they have been applied to investigate the fate of DOM in estuaries.</para>

          <para>Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were analyzed by a high-temperature combustion method with a Shimadzu TOC-5000A TOC analyzer.  In advance the analysis, samples were acidified with 3M HCl, and purged with N2 gas to remove inorganic C.  Ancillary physical and chemical parameters were measured using standar methods as part of on-going estuarine water quality monitoring program http://www.serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork.  Detailed methods will be found elsewhere.  For escitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurements, fluorescences spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba (France) Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150-W continuous output xenon arc lamp under condition of 5.7-nm excitation and 2-nm emission slit widths and a 0.25 second response time.  Forty-four emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths (lamda ex) between 240 and 455 nm at 5 nm intervals. Them emission wavelengths were scanned from lamda ex + 10 nm to lamda ex + 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble et al., 1993 and Coble, 1996).  All fluorescence spectra were acquired in ratio mode, whereby the sample (emission signal, S) and reference (excitation lamp output, R) signals were collected and the ratio (S/R) was calculated.  The ratio mode eliminates the influence of possible fluctuation and wavelength dependency of excitation lamp output. Several post-acquisition steps were involved in the correction of the fluorescence spectra.  First, an inner filter corrections was applied to the fluorescence data according to McKnight et al. (2001).  After inner filter corrections the sample EEM underwent spectral subtraction of the Milli-Q water to remove most of the effects due to Raman scattering.  Instrument bias related to wavelength dependent efficiencies of the specific instrument's optical components (gratings, mirrors, etc.) were then corrected by applying multiplication factors, supplied by the manufacturer, for both excitation and emission wavelengths for the range of observations.  Finally, the fluorescence intensity values were converted to quinine sulfate unit (QSU;1QSU=1 ngL-1 of quinine sulfate monohydroxide) to facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons (Coble et al., 1993).  From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  Milli-Q water was used as a reference for all fluorescence analysis.  UV-visible measurements of the water samples were carried out with 1cm quartz UV-visible cells at room temperature (20 degrees C), using a Varian CARY 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Milli-Q water was used as the reference.</para>

Instrument bias related to wavelength dependent efficiencies of the specific instrument's optical components (gratings, mirrors, etc.) were then corrected by applying multiplication factors, supplied by the manufacturer, for both excitation and emission wavelengths for the range of observations.  Finally, the fluorescence intensity values were converted to quinine sulfate unit (QSU;1QSU=1 ngL-1 of quinine sulfate monohydroxide) to facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons (Coble et al., 1993).  From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  Milli-Q water was used as a reference for all fluorescence analysis.  UV-visible measurements of the water samples were carried out with 1cm quartz UV-visible cells at room temperature (20 degrees C), using a Varian CARY 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer.

          <para>Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were analyzed by a high-temperature combustion method with a Shimadzu TOC-5000A TOC analyzer.  In advance the analysis, samples were acidified with 3M HCl, and purged with N2 gas to remove inorganic C.  Ancillary physical and chemical parameters were measured using standar methods as part of on-going estuarine water quality monitoring program http://www.serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork.  Detailed methods will be found elsewhere.  For escitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurements, fluorescences spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba (France) Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150-W continuous output xenon arc lamp under condition of 5.7-nm excitation and 2-nm emission slit widths and a 0.25 second response time.  Forty-four emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths (lamda ex) between 240 and 455 nm at 5 nm intervals. Them emission wavelengths were scanned from lamda ex + 10 nm to lamda ex + 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble et al., 1993 and Coble, 1996).  All fluorescence spectra were acquired in ratio mode, whereby the sample (emission signal, S) and reference (excitation lamp output, R) signals were collected and the ratio (S/R) was calculated.  The ratio mode eliminates the influence of possible fluctuation and wavelength dependency of excitation lamp output.

          <para>Water samples were collected monthly during October 2004 to September 2008 from a total of 17 sampling stations located in the coastal estuaries of the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula, USA. These stations were established for an on-going water quality monitoring program (http://www.serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork).  Sampling stations can be largely grouped into 3 distinct districts based on the geomorphological features, that is, Florida Bay (FB, 3 sampling stations), Shark River Slough (SRS, 6 sampling stations), and Taylor Slough (TSPH, 8 sampling stations).  Surface water samples were taken from the these stations.  The samples were collected using pre-washed, brown Nalgen polyethylene bottles (Nalge Nunc International). Salinity of the water samples was measured in the field using an Orion salinity meter. The samples were stored on ice and returned to the laboratory within 8 h for analysis. Subsamples for spectroscopic analysis were filtered through precombusted Whatman GF/F glass fiber filters once received in the laboratory and analyzed immediately.</para>

        <abstract>
          <para>We are investigating how variability in regional climate, freshwater inputs, disturbance, and perturbations affect the coastal Everglades ecosystem. Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para>

          <abstract>
            <para>Our FCE I research focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacts with a marine source of phosphorus (P), the limiting nutrient, to control estuarine productivity where these two influences meet-in the oligohaline ecotone. This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these "upside-down" estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is:  In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.  Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

            <abstract>
              <para>Coastal ecosystems are being modified at unprecedented rates through interacting
pressures of global climate change and rapid human population growth, impacting natural coastal
resources and the services they provide. Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence
freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences,
coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual &#226;&#128;&#156;upside-down&#226;&#128;&#157; productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.
