Datum of Station - Seven feet above ground level.
Equipment - J&amp;S Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge connected to Campbell Instruments Meteorlogical Data recorder.

Gauge Connection (Thick Gray Wire)
History

    * 19 July 1999: Station established in middle of horse pasture
    * 18 July 2002: Metal Conduit added to gauge by USGS to sheild wires from hungry horses. Conduit ran from top of gauge to ground and ran underground to data recorder. 


Panorama - This gauge is located in an open field, plagued only by the hungry horse. 
Calibration Measurements - Calibration of this gauge should be preformed as described in the users manual. Each bucket should hold 8.24 mL of water before tipping. This should occur five consecutive times. Adjust calibration screws as needed.
Extreme Events No extreme events have been observed to present.
Winter Records - Rain gauge is not heated and is subject to freezing.
Accuracy - Data should be processed through a quality control algorithm before use.
Cooperation - Baltimore Ecosystem Study, McDonogh School, USDA
Photographs - Print collections may be available. Contact the MD-DE-DC District Office about any collections in the official station records.  See Baltimore Ecosystem Study Meteorology Overview here: http://beslter.org/frame7-page_1p.html .

<geographicDescription>The Baltimore Ecosystem Study ultimately will conduct research and educational activities throughout the Baltimore metropolitan area. This large area includes Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and the counties of Ann Arundel, Carrol, Harford, Howard, and Montgomery. Gwynns Falls includes agricultural lands, recently suburbanized areas, established suburbs, and dense urban areas having residential, commercial and open spaces. In addition, a reference area has been established in a forested catchment of the Gunpowder drainage in Oregon Ridge County Park. </geographicDescription>
