      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR, flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites. Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site as the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location of Met Station 44. The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power lines.&#160; An earthen berm stops road travel here and the met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road. &#160; Vegetation: The Rio Salado Grassland site is Plains-Mesa Sand Scrub habitat characterized by
stabilized deep-sand dominated by coppice dunes of honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa). Co-dominant shrubs are sand sagebrush (Artemesia filifolia) and
fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), with winterfat (Krascheninnikovia
lanata), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), broom indigobush (Psorothamnus
scoparius), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia
sarothrae) as other notable shrubs. One-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) is
present as well, especially along shallow washes. Compared to the Black Grama
Core Site, grass cover is sparse and dominated by poverty threeawn (Aristida
divaricata), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), mesa and spike dropseed
(Sporobolus cryptandrus and S. contractus), as well as patches of black grama
(Bouteloua eriopoda). Notable forbs included spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa
wislizenii), tansy aster (Machaeranthera tanacetifolia), desert marigold
(Baileya multiradiata), Abert buckwheat (Eriogonum abertianum), dwarf gilia
(Ipomopsis pumila), rattlesnake weed (Chamaesyce albomarginata), blunt
tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala),
and Rocky Mountain zinnia (Zinnia grandiflora)., siteid: 13</geographicDescription>

Dominant grasses are black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), and fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum). Common forb species include desert holly (Acourtia nana), spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa spp.), blackfoot daisey (Melampodium leucanthum), twinleaf (Senna bauhinoides), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala). While individual creosote bushes tend to be larger, overall plant cover is less than at the creosote core site at Five Points, with more exposed embedded stones and gravel on the soil surface, creating a pavement-like appearance., </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Deep Well is located on McKenzie Flats and is site of the longest running SEV LTER met station, number 40, which has been active since 1988.&#160; In addition to studies of meteorological variables, core line-intercept vegetation transects and line-intercept transects from the 1995 and 2001 Deep Well fires are sampled here.&#160; The mini-rhizotron study, blue and black grama compositional comparison, blue and black grama patch dynamics investigation, and kangaroo rat population assessement are all ongoing here.&#160; Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is also the location of the warming and monsoon experiments, as well as portions of the line-intercept and vegetation removal studies.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the area of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed.&#160; While portions of this site were burned, the entirety was not.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the fire.Vegetation: The vegetation of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and blue grama (B. gracilis).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

I separated all the phenology data into three&#160; separate files.  The first file,"allstuff91-92" contains data from the very begining of the project, 4-4-91, to 5-26-92 when the sites were changed. The second file,"allstuff92", contains data for the remainder of the 1992 year.  Finally, this file,"allstuff93", contains all the data for the 1993&#160; year.  The logs for all three files is contained within this one.  I am Rupal Shah, and if you have any questions, come to me for answers. 24 Feb 1993 - began updating the documentation to correspond to the Sevilleta LTER data manager's guide to documentation.  Made into an rdb file and checked, all collumns projected out and made sure the data were o.k.There once was a huge file containing all of the phenology data ever collected, but Rupal Shah separated it into three parts. This is the first part.  It contains the original sites of fp,sc, bb, and dw.  The logs for this data is contained in the "allstuff93" file.  The log for this file corresponds to dates from the begining of the project which is 4-4-91 to the point when the sites were changed, 5-26-92. Today is Jan. 4th 1994, and I separated everything in the last week of December.  So, all the data for 1991,1992,and 1993 are contained within these three files.On Jan 21 1994 at 8:45am, Melissa Chavez began to revise the doccumentation to fit the guidelines given in "Data Tech's Manual for documenting"25 Jan 1994: added data set code and title section worked on when and how section.  Added Varialbe description and definitions.  - melissa chavezRio Salado phenology data for transect 1 and 3entered by M Altenbach, 26 May 1994; checked 27 May 1994Rio Salado 2 entered by jbocock 5/25/94.

Taugher - Added information on Kartesz codes (and reference) to the SPECIES section. K. Taugher - Added new Kartesz SPECIES CODE LIST. K. Taugher - Removed a column of "2"'s from the dataset. These were added as an artifact of the sas code conversion program used for the transect datasets which  was also used to convert the plant species codes in this dataset (see CODE CONVERSION in the documentation section below for a discussion of the code conversion process). This column was not a part of this dataset and was removed. K. Taugher - Changed the field positions in the 'VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS AND DEFINITIONS' section to reflect the current positions. As Kartesz codes may be up to 6 characters in length, an additional field position was added to the "code" column which then changed all the field positions that followed. K. Taugher - Realigned data columns to right justification. K. Taugher - Added Kartesz code conversion details including step by step details of how the conversion was done. K.

          <para>
            <literalLayout>DATA COLLECTION - The data were collected once each week during the summer months, namely June, July and August.  During the rest of the year, the data are collected at least once each month.  This data set contains data collected between the periods of April 4, 1991 and August 24, 1995.&#160;  Ideally all sites were sampled on the one day.STUDY SITES -BLACK BUTTE - This site is located just inside the gate south of Black Butte.&#160; The site is a sandy grassland, characterized by Oryzopsis hymenoides, Sporobolus giganteus, Sporobolus flexuosus, and Bouteloua eriopoda, occasional shrubs include Gutierrezia sarothrae, Yucca glauca, and Dalea scoparia.&#160; Herbs include Senecio douglasii, Baileyi multiradiata, and Sphaeralcea spp.DEEP WELL - The Deep Well site is west of the missile range road,  between the road and the Deep Well meteorological station. This is a  grassland site with shortgrass prairie species such as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and grasses with a more southern affinity such as black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).FIVE POINTS - The Five Points site is just east of the Five Points intersection and just north of the road. The site is dominated by creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), especially at the southern end of the transects.&#160; The transects get grassier toward the north. The herbaceous plants include Hoffmanseggia drepanocarpa, Haplopappus spinulosus, and Solanum eleagnifolium.&#160; The grasses include black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), burrograss (Scleropogonbrevifolius), Threeawns (Aristida spp.) and ring muhly (Muhlenbergiatorreyi).GOAT  DRAW - This is a pinyon/juniper site in the Los Pinos mountains.   Transect #1 ran across rocky hillslopes and through two rocky washes.   Transect #2 ran along a gravelly stream bed.  Transect #1 was covered  with pinyon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) trees and shrubs that included beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), feather dalea (Dalea formosa), shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella), and brown-spined prickly pear (Opuntia phaeacantha).Grasses in the area include hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), and side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula).  The second transect has shrubs that include cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and many herbs such as Verbena wrightii, Erodium cicutarium, and Lesquerella ovalifolia.RIO SALADO - This is a very sandy site.  The predominate grasses are Oryzopsis hymenoides, Hilaria jamesii, and Sporobolus flexuosus. The shrubs include four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosus), indigo bush (Dalea scoparia), Penstemon ambiguus and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). The herbaceous vegetation includes Cassia bauhinioides, Thelesperma megapotamicum, and Zinnia grandiflora.SEPULTURA CANYON - The Sepultura Canyon site is at the base of the canyon in the Los Pinos mountains.&#160; The transects cross one of the side channels that drain the canyon.&#160; The substrate is alluvial and often disturbed in the channel by water or on the banks by rodent activity. The shelves above the bank have grama grasses mixed with shrubs such as prickly pear and cholla (Opuntia spp.) and juniper trees.WATERSHED (RED TANK/222) - The transects in this site criss-cross a gravelly ephemeral stream bed in the foothills of the Sierra Ladrone Mountains.  The woody vegetation in this stream bed includes juniper (Juniperus monosperma), Brickellia californica, Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa).  On the hills are Junipers and shrubs such as cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata), beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), and Oreganillo (Aloysia wrightii). The herbs in the wash include Lesquerella ovalifolia, and Mirabilis multiflora.  The grasses found at this site include three-awn (Aristida sp.), fluff-grass Erioneuron pulchellum, and  four species of grama grass (Bouteloua spp.).TRANSECT DESCRIPTION - Black Butte, Deep Well, and Five Points each had three transects. Transects were 100 meters long, about 20 meters apart, and had a roughly a north/south azimuth.  The transects were situated to capture the vegetation that dominated and characterized each site.  Sepultura Canyon had four transects, each running from the shelf above the stream channel, across the channel to the other shelf. These transects were 50 meters long and situated to capture the diversity of  plants in the wash, up the banks, and on the shelf.HOW DATA WERE COLLECTED - The phenological data were collected by looking at the plants contained within the 50 x 1 meter transect (marked with rebar and sometimes string) and writing down the plant code (See Codes Used) if it was not already on the data sheet and circling the letter for the appropriate phenological condition. There is a description of each condition in the Variable Description and Definition.  Abiotic data such as weather conditions and temperature was not taken as these data could be obtained from the LTER meteorlogical data set. *******SAMPLE DATA SHEET********PHENOLOGY RIO SALADO I     DATE_________________WORKERS___________________________   PRECIPITATION________SOIL TEMP SURF______ .5m_____ TIME_____________________CODE |------------------------------------------------------------ARDI5 &#160;&#160; |P/G  V  B  FL  FR  M  S  D  NP------------------------------------------------------------ARPUP6&#160; |P/G  V  B  FL  FR  M  S  D  NP------------------------------------------------------------ATCA2 &#160;&#160; |P/G  V  B  FL  FR  M  S  D  NP------------------------------------------------------------Key:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;p/g = perennating or germinatingv = vegetatingb = buddingfl = floweringfr = fruitingm = dispersings = senescingd = deadnp = not presentDescriptions of these are in the section below.VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS AND DEFINITIONS - Definitions (Numbers in parenthesis indicate length of field):DATE (8) -  the date consists of the year, the month, and the date, in that order, transcribed numerically. e.g.  20 Apr 1991 = 19910420 There is a list of ranges in the "When" section above. SITE (2) - The site codes are:bb = Black Buttedw = Deep Wellfp = Five Pointsgd = Goat Drawrs = Rio Saladosc = Sepultura Canyonws = Watershed (Red Tank/222)TRANSECT (1) -  the transects are numbered 1 through 3 going from the western most transect to the eastern most transect.  The Sepultura site from 1991 contains four transects.SPECIES_CODE (6) -  The codes used for plants in this study follow the Kartesz abbreviation standard (Kartesz, J.T.  1994. A Synonymized&#160; Checklist of the&#160; Vascular Flora of the United States, Canada, and Greenland. Timber Press,&#160; Oregon).  This is a four-, five-, or six-letter case-sesitive code that represents the plant species in that record. The Kartesz codes are in all capital letters and can be found in the species&#160; codes list in this documentation section.If for any variety of reasons the individual could not be keyed to the species level (e.g. wrong phenological period and plant was not flowering, plant had been grazed, plant is a seedling and too young to identify, etc.) then a hierarchical naming scheme was employed, becoming more and more broad. For example, if the plant could not be identified to species, then in many cases it was identified to genus, if not to genus, then at least the family was known. Finally, the lifeform classification (e.g. tree,shrub,forb, etc.) could have been used. Note that in the case of unknown grasses, the lifeform of GRASS need not have been used because a narrower classification of family (i.e. Poaceae) may have been utilized.As there were no codes for "family" or "genus" specifically outlined by Kartesz, the Sevilleta LTER utilized its own hierarchical naming scheme which was as follows: If only the genus (or sometimes the family) was known, then the code given was the first five letters of the genus (or family)&#160; with only the first letter being capitalized (e.g. Aristida genus = Arist   Fabaceae family = Fabac). Species that remained unknown (and could not be keyed to even a family) were listed as UNK (all capitals) or as the appropriate lifeform (e.g. SHRUB, FORB, etc.).&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A comprehensive code list for all plant species found on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge and utilized by the Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research Project, can be found on the Sevilleta Information Management System (SIMS) in /export/db/local/plant/lib/species_kartesz_codes_.lst.The following fields represented the phenological condition of the plant species being observed.  A "y" in one of these fields indicated that the plant species was in that particular condition (described below).  A "n" indicated that the plant species did not match the description of phenological condition at that particular time and place.  GERMINATING/PERENNATING (1) -  coming up out of the ground, from a seed or a perennial part VEGETATING (1)    -  alive with no reproductive structures, not beginning or ending its life BUDDING (1)       -  had flower buds, pre-anthesis FLOWERING (1)    -  had flowers at anthesis FRUITING (1)     -  had fruits, after flowering but before dehiscence and/or dispersal DISPERSING (1)    -  fruits and/or seeds were dispersing from the plant DORMANT (1)       -  plant not vegetating or dead SENESCING  (1)    -  plant was dying DEAD (1)          -  plant was dead NOT PRESENT (1)  -  plant was gone, for whatever reason.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If an "x" was entered under either the category of either perennating or  dormant, it indicated that when the data was collected, these two  categories were not yet devised.
