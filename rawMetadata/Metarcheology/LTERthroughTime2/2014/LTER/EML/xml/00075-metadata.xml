<abstract>
<para>In this larger study, we are asking the question: Is old carbon that comprises the bulk of the soil organic matter pool released in response to thawing of permafrost?  We are answering this question by using a combination of field and laboratory experiments to measure radiocarbon isotope ratios in soil organic matter, soil respiration, and decomposition in tundra ecosystems.  The objective of these proposed measurements is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the SOM sources contributing to C losses following permafrost thawing.  We are making these measurements at  an established tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range.  Field measurements  center on a natural experiment where permafrost has been observed to warm and thaw over the past several decades.  This area represents a gradient of sites each with a different degree of change due to permafrost thawing.  As such, this area is unique for addressing questions at the time and spatial scales relevant for change in arctic ecosystems.  This data set is annual (September through September) mass loss of cellulose filter paper at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths in the soil profile in sites with minimal, moderate, and extensive degrees of permafrost thaw.</para>

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<para>The study site at the Eight Mile Lake watershed is located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range.  Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope at this site, in a 30 m deep borehole that was installed in 1985 before the permafrost started to thaw.  While permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding depending on local topography, this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands.  In this watershed, we monitored three sites that represented differing amounts of change as a result of permafrost thaw based on observations of ground subsidence and depth of thaw.  Our minimal thaw site had the shallowest summer thaw depth and the least ground surface subsidence, and the vegetation was typical moist acidic tundra, dominated by the tussock-forming sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, with coexisting deciduous and evergreen shrubs, and an understory of mosses and lichens.  A second site, located adjacent to the borehole, had moderate summer thaw depths and increased ground subsidence.  Here the vegetation composition was similar to our minimal thaw site, but with increased biomass of all plant groups.  Lastly, an extensive thaw site was located in an area where permafrost degradation had occurred at least several decades prior to the establishment of the borehole; thermokarst can already be observed in air photos of the area taken in 1954.  This site had the deepest summer thaw depth and the most ground subsidence, and the plant biomass has shifted to dominance by shrubs, including blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), at the expense of sedges.  Ten decomposition bags were incubated at each gradient site each year.	</para>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>FIELD:  Four individually-weighed 7.5 by 7.5 cm squares of cellulose filter paper (Fisher brand P8 09-802-1B) were placed into 21 by 21 cm fiberglass mesh bags. The bags were designed to measure decomposition at 0-10 cm and from 10-20 cm. Decomposition bags were placed into the soil vertically in September into a slit cut with a bread knife. They were left to incubate in the soil for a year and collected the following September. Each of the three thaw gradient sites had 10 bags each year. The incubations started in September 2004 and are continuing. This dataset includes 2004 through September 2012.   LAB:  After the incubation, the bags were rinsed, dried at 60 degrees C and each filter was cleaned of debris with paintbrushes and tweezers before measuring its final weight. For each filter paper, we calculated a percent mass loss by subtracting the final from the initial weight and dividing by 100. Mass loss of the two horizontally adjacent filters was averaged to get one number per depth per bag.</para>
