<abstract>
<para>To characterize spatial variation in the adult and juvenile density of periwinkle snails, Littoraria irrorata, within two zones in the salt marsh, the mid-marsh and creekbank, and across a gradient in salinity and distance to ocean, we surveyed snail density in October 2013. In each marsh zone at each GCE LTER permanent monitoring site, we counted the number of adult and juvenile snails in 8 replicate quadrats. Data was collected at all GCE domain sites as well as one additional Zizaniopsis site (label SCZ2).</para>

<title>Survey</title>
<para>At each site, 8 (creekbank) and 8 (mid-marsh) quadrats were haphazardly positioned  in line with the permanent vegetation plots. In each 50cm x 50cm plot, all &#8220;visible&#8221; Littoraria were counted, ignoring the tiny individuals that are not obvious to a simple visual scan. Then a 25 x 0.25 cm quadrat was placed in the center of the plot, and every plant stem was sampled for &#8220;recruit&#8221; individuals, looking inside all leaf furls. To do this, the furled leaf was pulled from the stem and any juvenile snails that were between 1-4mm at the base of the leaf were counted.</para>

Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</geographicDescription>

The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</geographicDescription>

<abstract><para>The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER is located along three adjacent sounds on the Atlantic coast and includes both intertidal marshes and estuaries. Long-term drivers of climate change, sea level rise and human alterations of the landscape will cause transitions in dominant habitat types (state changes) within the GCE domain by changing the amounts and patterns of water delivery across the landscape. These changes in water delivery can be conceptualized as presses and pulses in river inflow, local runoff, groundwater input, and tidal inundation, which will in turn manifest themselves as changes in salinity and inundation patterns in the domain. The research proposed for GCE-III is designed to address how variations in salinity and inundation, driven by climate change and anthropogenic factors, affect biotic and ecosystem responses at different spatial and temporal scales, and to predict the consequences of these changes for habitat provisioning and carbon (C) sequestration across the coastal landscape. The goals are to: 1) Track long-term changes in climate and human actions in the watershed and adjacent uplands, and evaluate the effects of these drivers on domain boundary conditions. 2) Describe temporal and spatial variability in physical, chemical, geological and biological, and to evaluate how they are affected by variations in river inflow and other boundary conditions. 3) Characterize the responses of three dominant habitats in the domain to pulses and presses in salinity and inundation. 4) Describe patterns of habitat provisioning and C sequestration and export in the GCE domain, and to evaluate how these might be affected by changes in salinity and inundation. These efforts will be synthesized into a synoptic understanding of both biotic and ecosystem responses to variations in salinity and inundation driven by climate change and human activities, which will be used to assess thresholds between habitats and the potential for state changes in the domain.</para></abstract>

<para>The GCE Data Toolbox is a comprehensive library of functions for metadata-based analysis
quality control, transformation and management of ecological data sets. The toolbox is based on the GCE Data 
Structure, a MATLAB specification for storing tabular data along with all information required to interpret 
the data and generate formatted metadata (documentation). Metadata fields in the structure are queried 
by toolbox functions for all operations, allowing functions to process and format values appropriately 
based on the type of information they represent. This semantic processing approach supports highly 
automated and intelligent data analysis and ensures data set validity throughout all processing steps.</para>

<qualityControl>
<description>
<para>Quality control analysis was performed using the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB software. Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Automatically-assigned qualifier flags are reviewed graphically and revised or augmented as deemed appropriate by GCE information management staff, based on metadata information from the contributor, values of other measured variables, or statistical tests. Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.</para>
