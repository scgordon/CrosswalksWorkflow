  <abstract>
    <section>
      <para>Observations of the soil surface on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge indicate that the surface is subject to reduced microtopographic variation following fires.&#160; Bridges were used in this study to measure the dynamics of the soil surface in a creosote-grassland transition area to test this hypothesis. The soil bridge will allow for repeated measurements of the relative height of the soil surface following treatments at the experimental sites.</para>

            <literalLayout> Experimental Design:The purpose of this experiment was to determine the magnitude and direction of change in the soil surface at burned, manually cleared, and control plots in a creosote-grassland transition area west of 5-points. The locations chosen were thought to be characteristic of this transition zone.&#160; The treatments were burned (by prescribed fire that was started and aided with propane-fueled burners), manually cleared of creosote with limb cutters, and control.&#160;&#160; Each treatment has a total of 3 plots, which were selected by other researchers using unknown criteria.&#160; Installation of the bridge on each plot was selected to include approximately half the bridge beneath a creosote bush and the other half including grass and open soil.&#160; All bridge installation and following measurements were made from a ladder that spanned the study plot supported on blocks located outside the edge of the plot.&#160; The surface of the plot was never touched to eliminate soil compaction. &#160;The first end rebar (24 in.) was driven in to the ground under a creosote canopy until about 15 to 20 mm extended above the soil surface. The bridge was then placed over the rebar and the location for the second rebar was determined by the position of the hole in the other end of the bridge. &#160;The second rebar was driven to the proper depth to level the bridge (determined by the bubble level permanently mounted on the bridge). When the bridge was level, wood shims were inserted into the end of the bridge to secure the bridge around the rebar and to make the bridge more rigid. &#160;A pointed aluminum pin (60 cm) was inserted through hole #16 (the middle hole) and lowered to the soil&#160;surface to indicate placement of the spike (with depression in head). The bridge was removed and the spike driven until the head was flush with the soil surface. &#160;The bridge was replaced, the middle pin inserted through the bridge into the depression in the head of the spike and shims inserted into the end of the bridge. &#160;Pins were inserted through the holes in the bridge and lowered to the soil surface. &#160;If the pin struck vegetation while being inserted, canopy&#160;coverage was recorded for that pin (indicated by a '1' in cover column; '0' indicates no cover). &#160;If the pin struck plant basal coverage at the soil surface, basal cover was recorded (indicated by a '1' in basal cover column; '0' indicates no basal cover). &#160;If the portion of the bridge above that measurement pin was within the canopy of a creosote bush, shrub cover was recorded for that pin (indicated by a '1' in shrub cover column; '0' indicates no shrub cover). &#160;If the soil surface was not hard enough to support the pin, the pin was secured by a clothespin at the top of the bridge. &#160;The height of each pin above the bridge was recorded only to the nearest mm (or last mm mark to be&#160;seen above the pin). &#160;After heights of all 31 pins (including #16, the middle reference pin above the spike) and their canopy or basal intercept were recorded, the bridge was removed, leaving the two end rebar pieces and the middle spike for permanent reference.</literalLayout>
            <literalLayout>Data Collection Methods: Treatments included: Control (bridge# 7193, 7192, 7187) Burned (bridges# 7195, 7190, 1988) Cleared (bridge# 7194, 7189, 7191)</literalLayout>

      <instrumentation>Instrumentation:The soil bridge consists of a 6 ft. length of 1.5 in. (OD) aluminum square bar or tubing. &#160;Beginning at 16.5 cm, brass bushings were set in the tubing at 5 cm intervals (31 each). &#160;A bubble level was secured to the top of the bridge (the bubble level was always on the left side of the bridge, hole #1 the closest to the level). &#160;A hole centered at approximately 5 cm from each end of the bridge was made in the bottom of the bar to fit over the rebar that is driven into the ground.&#160; A piece of hardened steel approximately 4-cm in length, centered above the hole made for the rebar, replaced the aluminum portion of the bridge to keep a reproducible surface to rest on the rebar.&#160; The bridge is removed from the rebar after each measurement and stored at the Biology Annex.&#160; </instrumentation>
