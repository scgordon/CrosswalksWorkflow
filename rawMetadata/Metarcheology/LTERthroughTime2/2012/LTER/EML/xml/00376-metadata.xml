  <abstract>
    <section>
      <para> A 4" diameter cylindric graduated rain gage (11" x 0.01" capacity)
 is mounted on a 4x4 inch diameter redwood post or on a wooden
 exclosure post next to gate at or near the 15 LTER-II NPP sites.
 Collection is made monthly on the day that monthly soil water
 content measurements are made to correlate precipitation input
 with belowground water content.

 Data is collected primarily from graduated rain gauges. However,
 when missing data would result otherwise, amounts from the closest
 rain gauge are used in order to maintain as complete a data set as
 possible for that site. The rain gauge used is identified with
 each rainfall record. Other types that may be used are the Standard
 Can Gauge (DSRG or dipstick rain gauge), Belfort Weigh Bucket Rain
 Gauge (WBRG), and Qualimetrics Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge (TBRG).</para>

      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

Please send 1 copy of any publication that cites Jornada Basin LTER data to:

        <section>
          <para>
            <literalLayout> Volumes are measured monthly from 4" diameter cylindrical
 graduated rain gages (GRG) in conjuction with the monthly
 measurement of soil water content made at the 15 NPP sites. Mineral
 oil is added as necessary to prevent evaporation. Mineral oil is
 only used in GRG type of rain gauge. Aluminum window screening is
 placed in top of GRG's to prevent insects and debri from becoming
 trapped in mineral oil and water which would otherwise distort the
 amount collected.

 See SITE INFORMATION above for location of GRG's. The GRG's at
 C-UPTR, C-CALI, G-IBPE, and G-SUMM were originally associated with
 hydrology natural runoff plots. The volumes in these 4 gages were
 measured whenever the hydrology plots were collected. The hydrology
 plot study terminated in November 1994. The GRG gage at C-UPTR was
 read weekly for many years before changing to monthly collection.

 For periods of missing data, data from various rain gages (used
 nearest gage to NPP site) operated by LTER, NMSU Animal and Range
 Science (formerly named College Ranch, now Chihuahuan Desert
 Research Center (CDRRC)), or the USDA Jornada Experimental Range
 (JER) may have been used. The gage used is indicated within the
 data set and its description given. Typically, for missing data,
 the amount is obtained from nearest Standard Can Gage maintained by
 either JER or CDRRC. These Standard Can Gages (sometimes referred
 to as "dipstick rain gages) do not use anything to prevent
 evaporation. CDRRC gages are usually read after a precipitation
 event. JER gages are read once a week.

 GRG used for totals if possible. If not, the next closest rain
 gage is used. Precip is total since last date. GRGs are at all NPP
 sites now. Initially, G-BASN rainfall was used for P-COLL and
 T-WEST was used for T-EAST (which are within a few hundred meters of
 the other site). Time of collection is monthly for each site in
 association with the soil water content measurements made at the 15
 NPP sites, though there may be more frequent collections for those 4
 sites mentioned above that are associated with hydrology natural
 run-off plots; they are collected whenever a run-off event occurs.
 Also, frequency may vary when obtaining data for missing GRG
 periods.


 Interpretation of gages used:

 TBRG at C-UPTR, C-CALI, G-SUMM, G-IBPE: tipping bucket
 rain gage is linked to Belfort long term event recorder, which
 continually records precipitation events. Chart reflects
 amount, duration/intensity, and day/time of event.
 GRG are at all NPP sites. Time of collection is monthly for each
 site in association with the soil water content measurements
 made at the 15 NPP sites, though may be more frequent
 collections for those 4 sites mentioned above that are
 associated with hydrology plots; they are collected whenever a
 run-off event occurs.

 03/11/1998 Initial installation of GRG at P-COLL. Used G-BASN GRG before.
 04/03/1998 Initial installation of GRG at C-SAND. Used C-UPTR GRG before.
 04/03/1998 Initial installation of GRG at T-EAST. Used T-WEST GRG before.
 USDA WBRG and/or DSRG volumes from Rabbit Rain Gage may have
 been used for M-RABB during certain periods.
 Animal and Range Science (College Ranch) DSRG (DSRG=east
 mountain south gage) may have been used for C-GRAV during
 certain periods.
 Animal and Range Science (College Ranch) DSRG (DSRG=vine
 mesquite gage) may have been used for P-SMAL during
 certain periods.

 A macro within the Quattro Pro file, NPP_GRG.WB1, is
 used to enter and maintain the data in spreadsheet format.
 This data is then output to the ascii file, NPP_GRG.RAW.

 Data processing:
 1. Macro autoloads into data entry screen when NPP_GRG.WB1 in
 Quattro Pro for Windows (version 5) is opened.
 2. Enter data from Probe Field Data sheet.
 3. Execute macro after data entry to output data to text file
 called NPP_GRG.RAW which includes all data columns.
 4. Edit NPP_GRG.RAW. Keep data, time, amount, gauge columns and
 save as NPP_GRG.DAT.
 5. Update NPP_GRG.DBF. Use TEMP_GRG.DBF, then replace NPP_GRG.DBF.
 NOTE: ALT-M to bring up macro menu with options.
 CTL-BREAK to exit macro at any time.

 Beginning 10/7/2011: KeysPunch Data Entry software program is used
 to enter and verify the data through double entry. Additional
 validation checks are made during data entry. These fields are
 autogenerated cased on the site: loc_gage, id_gage, type, gu, ownr.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha 
                         Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State 
                         University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is 
                         administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER 
                         Network, one of  more than 25 long term sites funded by the U.S. National Science 
                         Foundation.</literalLayout>
