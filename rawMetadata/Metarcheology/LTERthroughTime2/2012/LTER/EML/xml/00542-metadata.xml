These data sets begin March 1988  and ends December 2003.  Rain and throughfall samples are  the total catch for the week, and are  exposed to field conditions for that  time. No event sampling is  conducted on a routine basis. Rainfall Collected in  Bisley (RCB) are  bulk or always-open collectors that receive dry deposition by   sedimentation.  All samples are measured for pH  and conductivity, and then filtered  (pre-combusted Whatman GF/F glass fiber  filter) prior to further  analysis. From 1983-1994 samples were cooled and  returned to the San  Juan  chemistry laboratory for analysis. During those years, samples for  NH4  and NO3 analyses were refrigerated continuously until analysis.  Sub  samples for NH4 analysis were also preserved with 1 molar HCl. From   1994 on, samples for NH4 and NO3 were frozen until  analysis, were not  acidified, and all analyses were conducted at the University of New  Hampshire.  Nutrient  fluxes in rainfall and throughfall were measured weekly in a  mature subtropical  wet forest in NE Puerto Rico over a 15-year period  that included the effects of  five hurricanes and several prolonged  droughts.  Annual inputs of K, Ca, Mg, Cl, Na, and SO4-S are similar to   those reported from other marine-influenced tropical forests.  Rainfall input of nitrogen is comparatively low  and reflects the  relative isolation of the air shed. Mean annual rainfall and  throughfall were  3482 and 2131 mm yr-1 respectively. On average,  rainfall, throughfall, rainfall  pH, and rainfall flux NH4-N and NO3-N  had small but  significant decreases throughout the study period. More  nutrients fluxes had seasonal  differences in rainfall (6 out of 12)  than throughfall (4 out of 12). All volume weighted enrichment ratios   calculated for the 15-year period were greater than one. However,  median weekly enrichment ratios were  less than 1 for sea salts and  dissolved organic carbon and between 1 and 2 for  Mg, Ca, SiO2 and  SO4-S.  In contrast, median weekly enrichment ratios were greater than  10 for NH4-N,  PO4-P, and K and reflect biological enrichment within the   canopy. Droughts reduced enrichment  ratios of cations and sea-salts,  but increased enrichment ratios for NH4-N,  PO4-P and K. In the weeks   following hurricanes relative throughfall tends to be higher and  enrichment  ratios tend to be lower. These long-term observations  indicate that physical and  biological processes associated with water  passing through the canopy act to  buffer internal nutrient cycles from  inter-annual, and seasonal variations in  rainfall inputs.</literalLayout></para></abstract><intellectualRights><section><title>Data Policies</title><para><literalLayout>Copyright 2001 Long Term Ecological Research Network -
