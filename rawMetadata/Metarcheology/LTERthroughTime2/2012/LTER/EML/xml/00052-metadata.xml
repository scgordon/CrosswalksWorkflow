		<abstract>
			<para>These data were compiled from multiple sources. We collated data on the abundance or
				density of aquatic invasive and native species sampled in more than 20 sites using the same
				methods. To control for sampling methodology and allow comparisons among native and invasive
				species, we only included data where both invasive and native species from a taxonomic group
				were sampled using the same methods across multiple sites. Exceptions were made to include
				rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) in its native range and zebra mussel (Dreissena
				polymorpha) data. </para>

						<para>To control for sampling methodology and allow comparisons among native and
							invasive species, we only included data where both invasive and native species from a
							taxonomic group were sampled using the same methods across multiple sites. Exceptions
							were made to include rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) in its native range and
							zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) data. Native rusty crayfish data were obtained
							from (Jezerinac 1982). Zebra mussel data were mainly obtained from a meta-analysis
							(Naddafi et al. 2011) which compiled data from 55 European and 13 North American sites
							from 1959-2004. Additional densities from North America were compiled from multiple
							primary literature sources (Table S3). All zebra mussel records were presented as
							number per m2 and are from their invaded range; we did not include native mussel data.
							Crayfish data were obtained from multiple sources. Crayfish were collected in
							Wisconsin, USA during summers of 2002-2010 from lakes in the Northern Highlands Lake
							District following their protocol for crayfish collection. Crayfish were sampled in
							Wisconsin streams tributary to Lake Michigan from 2007-2010 using 10 gee-style minnow
							traps per site baited with chicken livers and set overnight. Swedish crayfish were
							sampled using 30 minnow traps baited with frozen fish in lakes and streams of southern
							Sweden from 2001-2003 as described in (Nystrom et al. 2006). Washington crayfish were
							collected from 100 lakes in the Puget Sound Lowlands region of Washington State, USA
							between 2007 and 2009 from mid-June to early October of each year. At each lake, the
							investigators set 20 minnow traps baited with fish-based dog food. Traps were deployed
							in four clusters of five traps each and recovered the following day. All crayfish
							densities are presented as number per trap per day, with the exception of native range
							rusty crayfish data, which were reported as number per site (Jezerinac 1982) and
							excluded from all comparisons that depend on sampling units. Wisconsin fish data were
							collected from streams throughout the state from 2005-2010 using either a backpack or
							towboat electrofisher with pulsed DC current in wadeable (less than1m depth) streams
							for a minimum of 15 minutes. For Wisconsin trout species, locations sampled within 10
							years following a stocking event of that species were excluded. Lamprey data were
							collected from 2008-2010 from Great Lakes tributaries using backpack electrofishers
							following standardized methods as a part of the sea lamprey assessment program of the
							United States Fish and Wildlife Service and Department of Fisheries and Oceans,
							Canada. North American fish densities are presented as number per minute of sampling.
							Swedish fish data were collected using backpack electrofishing between 1980 and 2010
							from streams in Vasterbotten county, northern Sweden, and were obtained from the
							Swedish Electrofishing REgister (SERS), www.fiskeriverket.se, and are reported as
							number per 100 m of stream. Snail data were collected in 2006 from lakes in the
							Northern Highlands Lake District in Wisconsin as described by (Solomon et al. 2010),
							and densities are presented as number per two m2. Aquatic plant data were collected
							using a systematic grid-based point-intercept sampling methodology to record
							macrophyte frequency of occurrence in 242 Wisconsin lakes from 2005-2008. Aquatic
							plant presence absence was recorded from a boat using a double-sided rake sampler at
							each point on a sampling grid as described in (Mikulyuk et al. 2010). Density data are
							presented as proportion of sites within lake littoral zone where a species was
							present. For all data, if multiple records existed from the same location, we used the
							most recent record. If replicate samples existed within the same site on the same
							sampling date, the mean value was used. </para>

			<abstract>
				<para>North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research studies the ecology of lakes as
					one of a network of sites established by the National Science Foundation. We are
					interested in how biophysical setting, climate, and changing land use and cover interact
					to shape lake characteristics and dynamics over time (past, present, future). Our primary
					study sites include a set of seven northern Wisconsin and four southern Wisconsin lakes
					and their surrounding landscapes. The project, which started in 1981, is administered by
					the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Perception of Long-Term
					Change: How and why have the lake districts changed, and how will they change in the
					future? Climatic Forcing of Change: What are the major ecological and social responses of
					lake districts to climate change? Interacting Drivers, Scales of Space and Time, and
					Regional Change: How do multiple interacting drivers affect regional change in lake
					districts at multiple scales? Ecosystem Services: Past, Present and Future: What are the
					magnitudes, interactions and potential future flows of ecosystem services in lake
					districts? </para>
