History

    * 19 July 1999 Gauge is established.
    * 12 July 2002 Bird deterrant device installed on gauge. Device consists of wire fencing cut so that prongs stick up towards sky. Wire is then secured in a loop tight enough to stay on the funnel. Tape is wrapped around device to protect user and allow for easy removal. Height of device does not exceed 1.5cm above gauge lip.
    * 20 August 2002 Bird deterrant device determined to be ineffective and was removed. This determination was made after consecutive finds of bird feces while servicing. Plans have been made to tray another method. Calibration was checked, 150 mL with 16 tips. 

Panorama - This gauge is located in a open feild bounded by forest and roads.
Calibration Measurements - Calibration of this gauge should be preformed as described in the users manual. Each bucket should hold 8.24 mL of water before tipping. This should occur five consecutive times. Adjust calibration screws as needed.
Extreme Events No extreme events have been observed to present.
Winter Records - Rain gauge is not heated and is subject to freezing.
Accuracy - Data should be processed through a quality control algorithm before use.
Cooperation - Baltimore Ecosystem Study, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Oregon Ridge Park
Photographs - Print collections may be available. Contact the MD-DE-DC District Office about any collections in the official station records.   .  See Baltimore Ecosystem Study Meteorology Overview here: http://beslter.org/frame7-page_1p.html .

"WY2011 CKVL Data QC'd KTBelt, Jan011 2011"

The CKVL rain gage is located just to the east of Oregon Ridge and the BARN/POBR stream gages.
"Lat-Long Coordinates: 39.474, -76.621"
"Measurments are made with a Novalynx 8"" manual gage, a 260-2510 National Weather Service Type
Rain and Snow Gauge."
Narrative observations are also made regarding weather conditions at the time of measurment and general storm and freezing events.
All Observations by KT Belt
"Snow cover and depth measurements, and rain gage measurements are made twice a day (0600 hrs and 1800 hrs)"
"Snow cover is estimated by eye, by observing the % of a flat lawn area (ca. 6 x 10 m) adjacent to the CKVLL the rain gage."
Snow depth is measured (to the nearest 0.1 cm) on a snowboard (ca 1 m2) near (within ca 2 m) of the CKVL NL gage.
"NL gage measurments include a ""stick"" measurment (as per NWS protocol), and a volume measurement (in ml)"
NL gage measurements are adjusted to compsensate for small errors in the area of the rain funnel orifice (5.91 % error) and the snow orifice (2.91 % error).
"QC includes comparing results to surrounding gages (mostly MSC, BWI) and examining points on the NL P (in) vs Volume (ml) plot."
"QC also includes comparing data to a Novalynx 260-2531 4"" gage (1 m height) that is ca 1.5 m from the NL gage (abbrev NLs)."

<geographicDescription>The Baltimore Ecosystem Study ultimately will conduct research and educational activities throughout the Baltimore metropolitan area. This large area includes Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and the counties of Ann Arundel, Carrol, Harford, Howard, and Montgomery. Gwynns Falls includes agricultural lands, recently suburbanized areas, established suburbs, and dense urban areas having residential, commercial and open spaces. In addition, a reference area has been established in a forested catchment of the Gunpowder drainage in Oregon Ridge County Park. </geographicDescription>
