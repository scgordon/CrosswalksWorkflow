    <section>
      <para>This dataset contains pinon-juniper    woodland quadrat data and is part of a long-term study at the  Sevilleta LTER measuring net primary production (NPP) across four   distinct  ecosystems: creosote-dominant shrubland (Site C, est. winter   1999),  black grama-dominant grassland (Site G, est. winter 1999), blue    grama-dominant grassland (Site B, est. winter 2002), and pinon-juniper    woodland (Site P, est. winter 2003). Net primary production is a  fundamental ecological variable that  quantifies rates of carbon  consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP  are important in  understanding energy flow at a community level as well  as spatial and  temporal responses to a range of ecological processes. Above-ground net  primary production is the change in plant biomass,  represented by stems, flowers, fruit and and foliage, over time and  incoporates growth as well as loss to  death and decomposition. To  measure this  change the vegetation variables in this dataset, including  species composition and the cover and height of individuals, are  sampled twice yearly (spring and fall) at permanent 1m x 1m plots within  each site. A third sampling at Site C is performed in the winter. The  data from these plots is used to  build regressions correlating biomass  and volume via weights of select harvested species obtained in SEV157,  "Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data." This biomass data is  included in SEV182, "Seasonal Biomass and Seasonal and Annual NPP for  Core Research Sites."</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Cerro Montosa Pinyon-Juniper site has been the location of major Sevilleta LTER research since 1989. Meteorological trends, net primary productivity, rodent and ground-dwelling arthropod populations, mycorrhizal responses to fertilizer, pinyon-juniper fruit and nut production, and pinyon mortality are all being investigated at this site. Previous studies have included analyses of pinyon tree rings for regional climate reconstruction.Vegetation: The vegetation is New Mexico Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, dominated by Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), and accompanied by gray oak (Quercus grisea).  There is a diverse shrub component, including scrub live oak (Q. turbinella), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), sacahuista (Nolina microcarpa), red barberry (Mahonia haematocarpa), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), skunkbush (Rhus trilobata), and banana yucca (Yucca baccata).  Grass diversity is also high, and open spaces between trees are dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), with hairy and sideoats grama (B. hirsuta and B. curtipendula) and black grama (B. eriopoda) also being significant. Other common grasses include purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), wolftail (Lycurus phleoides), mountain and ring muhly (M. montanus and M. torreyi), and New Mexican porcupinegrass (Heterostipa neomexicana). Common forbs include small-flowered milkvetch (Astragalus nuttallianus), white sagebrush (Artemesia ludoviciana), Fendler&#8217;s arabis (Arabis fendleri), Fendler&#8217;s sandmat (Chamaesyce fendleri), New Mexico thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum), false pennyroyal (Hedeoma oblongifolia), bastard sage (Eriogonum wrightii), ping&#252;e rubberweed (Hymenoxys richardsonii), large four o&#8217;clock (Mirabilis multiflora), Fendler's penstemon (Penstemon fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea hastulata and S. wrightii). , </geographicDescription>

          <para>
            <literalLayout>Locating the Sampling Quadrats:Site  P, the pinon-juniper woodland site (Cerro Montosa), is set-up   differently than the other core sites. In order to accommodate the   different habitat types, groups of transects (i.e., "plots") were set up along   north (N) and south (S) facing slopes as well as along vegas (V) and   ridges (R). Transects on the first two plots consist of 40 quads each   (10 quadrants for each of four habitat types). Plot one is slightly   west of plot three and plot two is slightly west of the weather   station. Plot three is located on a wide piedmont, which consists of   four transects with five quadrats on each.Collecting the Data:Net primary production  data is collected twice each year, spring and fall, for all sites. The  Five Points Creosote Core Site is also sampled in winter. Spring  measurements are taken in April or May when shrubs and spring annuals  have reached peak biomass. Fall measurements are taken in either  September or October when summer annuals have reached peak biomass but  prior to killing frosts. Winter measurements are taken in February  before the onset of spring growth.Vegetation data is collected on  a palm top computer. A 1-m2 PVC-frame is placed over the fiberglass  stakes that mark the diagonal corners of each quadrat. When measuring  cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the  quadrat to prevent errors caused by angle of view (parallax). Each  PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string. The dimensions  of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 percent of the total  area.The cover (area) and height of each individual live (green)  vegetative unit that falls within the one square meter quadrat is  measured. A vegetative unit consists of an individual size class (as  defined by a unique cover and height) of a particular species within a  quadrat. Cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm  squares filled by each vegetative unit. Niners and plexidecs are  additional tools that help accurately determine the cover a vegetative  unit. A niner is a small, hand-held PVC frame that can be used to  measure canopies. Like the larger PVC frame it is divided into 10cm x  10cm squares, each square representing 1% of the total cover.  However,  there are only nine squares within the frame, hence the name &#8220;niner.&#8221; A  plexidec can help determine the cover of vegetative units with covers  less than 1%. Plexidecs are clear plastic squares that are held above  vegetation.  Each plexidec represents a cover of 0.5% and has smaller  dimensions etched onto the surface that correspond to 0.01%, 0.05%,  0.1%, and 0.25% cover. It is extremely important that cover and  height measurements remain consistent over time to ensure that  regressions based on this data remain valid. Field crew members should  calibrate with each other to ensure that observer bias does not  influence data collection.Cover Measurements: Grasses-To  determine the cover of a grass clump, envision a perimeter around the  central mass or densest portion of the plant, excluding individual long  leaves, wispy ends, or more open upper regions of the plant. Live  foliage is frequently mixed with dead foliage in grass clumps and this  must be kept in mind during measurement as our goal is to measure only  plant biomass for the current season. In general, recently dead foliage  is yellow and dead foliage is gray. Within reason, try to include only  yellow or green portions of the plant in cover measurement while  excluding portions of the plant that are gray. This is particularly  important for measurements made in the winter when there is little or no  green foliage present. In winter, sometimes measurements will be based  mainly on yellow foliage. Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not  rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a  separate observation from the parent plant. Forbs, shrubs and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-The  cover of forbs, shrubs and sub-shrubs is measured as the horizontal  area of the plant. If the species is an annual it is acceptable to  include the inflorescence in this measurement if it increases cover. If  the species is a perennial, do not include the inflorescence as part of  the cover measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the  current season, including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid  measuring gray foliage that died in a previous season. Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha, Opuntia imbricata)  measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest cm instead of  cover and height. Cacti that occur as a dense ball/clump of stems (Opuntia leptocaulis) are measured using the same protocol as shrubs. Pincushion or hedgehog cacti (Escobaria vivipara, Schlerocactus intertextus, Echinocereus fendleri) that occur as single (or clustered) cylindrical stems are measured as a single cover. Yuccas-Make  separate observations for the leaves and caudex (thick basal stem).  Break the observations into sections of leaves that are approximately  the same height and record the cover as the perimeter around this group  of leaf blades. The caudex is measured as a single cover. The thick  leaves of yuccas make it difficult to make a cover measurement by  centering yourself over the caudex of the plant. The cover of the caudex  may be estimated by holding a niner next to it or using a tape measure  to measure to approximate the area. Height Measurements: Height  is recorded as a whole number in centimeters. All heights are vertical  heights but they are not necessarily perpendicular to the ground if the  ground is sloping. Annual grasses and all forbs-Measure  the height from the base of the plant to the top of the inflorescence  (if present). Otherwise, measure to the top of the green foliage. Perennial grasses-Measure  the height from the base of the plant to the top of the live green  foliage. Do not include the inflorescence in the height measurement. The  presence of live green foliage may be difficult to see in the winter.  Check carefully at the base of the plant for the presence of green  foliage. If none is found it may be necessary to pull the leaf sheaths  off of several plants outside the quadrat. From this you may be able to  make some observations about where green foliage is likely to occur. Perennial shrubs and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-Measure  the height from the base of the green foliage to the top of the green  foliage, ignoring all bare stems. Do not measure to the ground unless  the foliage reaches the ground.Plants rooted outside but hanging into a quadrat-Do not measure the height from the ground. Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat.&#160;Creosote Measurements:To measure creosote (i.e., Larrea tridenta) break the observations into two categories:1.)  Small, individual clusters of foliage on a branch (i.e., branch  systems): Measure the horizontal cover of each live (i.e., green)   foliage cluster, ignoring small open spaces (keeping in mind the 15%   guideline stated above). Then measure the vertical "height" of each   cluster from the top of the foliage to a plane created by extending a   line horizontally from the bottom of the foliage. Each individual   foliage cluster within a bush is considered a separate observation.2.)  Stems: Measure the length of each stem from the base to the  beginning  of live (i.e., green) foliage.  Calculate the cumulative total  of all  stem measurements.  This value is entered under "height" with  the  species as "stem" for each quadrat containing creosote.  All other   variable receive a default entry of "1" for creosote stem measurements. Do  not measure dead stems or areas of dead foliage.  If in doubt  about  whether a stem is alive, scrape the stem with your fingernail and  check  for the presence of green cambium. Recording the Data: Excel  spreadsheets are used for data entry and file names should begin with  the overall study (npp), followed by the date (mm.dd.yy) and the  initials of the recorder (.abc). Finally, the site abbreviation should  be added (i.e., c, g, b, p). The final format for sites B, G, and C  should be as follows: npp_core.mm.dd.yy.abc.xls. For site P, the file  format should be npp_pinj.mm.dd.yy.abc.xls. File names should be in  lowercase.</literalLayout>
