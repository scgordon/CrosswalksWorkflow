This objective was approached in three ways: 
 
A) 37 old fields of various ages were surveyed for above and below ground biomass, soil N, and light penetration. Five strips (1m x 10cm) were clipped in each field for above ground biomass (sorted to grasses and forbs; then sorted to leaf and stem), and 3 root cores (down to 30cm) taken per strip (rinsed, dried and weighed). Two light measurements and one pooled (3 cores) soil N sample (for available and total N) were taken per strip. 
 
B) 35 abundant species of known successional status were harvested from the field (usually 15 individuals per species), including roots contained in a core 20x30cm, dried, sorted to stem, leaf, and root, and weighed. These data can be combined with the old field survey results (E014) to estimate successional trends in allocation. 
 
C) Root cores will be taken from microplots in fields A, B, C, and D, all treatments. This will be an estimate of root biomass to be combined with the above ground samples (E001) to assess root-shoot trends in response to manipulation of soil N in fields of different age.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="theme">Biodiversity</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Climatic Variation</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Disturbance Patterns</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Ecology</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Ecosystem functioning</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Fire Frequency</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Long Term</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Nitrogen limitation</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Nutrient Budgets</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Nutrient Cycles</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Plant Competition</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Primary Productivity</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Successional dynamics</keyword></keywordSet><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage id="geoReferenceID" scope="document"><geographicDescription>The Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

Integrating Quantum/Radiometer/Photometer, model LI-188B. Two people were needed to take light readings with this system. One would hold the control box and record data and the other would hold the light sensor. The batteries would be checked before starting each session. If the batteries were OK, they would proceed to take readings. The sensor was connected to the control box by a relatively short cord, so the two people taking readings were required to stay close together. When taking readings, it was necessary to get a range value for each light value entered. If the integrating time of 1 second was not sufficient, it was increased to 10 seconds. This was also recorded. 
 
In 1989, two new light meters were acquired. These are SF Sunfleck Ceptometers, model SF-40 (40cm probe). They were purchased from Decagon Devices, Inc., P.O. Box 835, Pullman, WA 99163. One person can easily handle a ceptometer alone. This makes is possible for three people to get the readings done more quickly and easily. One person records data while the other two take readings from the plots simultaneously. No range values are needed. To take readings a person needs to select function #1 (PAR readings), position the probe (see below) and press ``A' (read value). More than one reading can be taken and then averaged by pressing a certain sequence of letters (A, A, B, B, A). 
 
Measurements are taken within a 4 hour period, 2 hours on either side of solar noon. (Solar noon is half way between sunrise and sunset; it is not 1200 hours). Solar noon is at 1315 hours, Central Daylight Time. Samples are taken between 1115 hours and 1515 hours. Measurements are not taken when the plot being sampled is shaded. Light readings are done when the sky is clear, whenever possible. If a cloud passes over the plot being sampled, assistants wait for the cloud to pass before taking the readings. If the sky is mostly cloudy, light meter readings are not taken. 
 
Two measurements are taken in each plot. Each measurement consists of one reading above the vegetation and a second reading at ground level. Both values are taken to get the percent of sunlight above the vegetation that reaches ground level. In taking the above vegetation reading, the sensor must be kept level, held high above all vegetation, kept out of the shade (of plants and people) and it must be clean. When taking the below vegetation reading, at ground level, the sensor must be kept level, out of the soil and out of the shade created by people. 
 
In 1991, light meter readings were only taken in E026 and E055. Light profiles were taken using an A-shaped frame made of aluminum. Wires were strung across the frame at 10cm intervals. The frame was placed over the subplot being metered. A reading was taken over the top of the frame, and then at each 10cm level, by placing the light meter across the wires, starting at 90cm above the ground. Readings were taken every 10cm down the frame and again at ground level. 
Light Data Transformations: 
Light readings are transformed to obtain percent light penetration which represents the percent of light above the vegetation that reaches the ground surface. In cases where the experiment involves shading, another variable is computed to reflect the percent of sun light that reaches above the canopy. This variable is called light available. In the case of absence of artificial shades, the latter is set to 1. 
 
percent light penetration = ( Light below canopy / Light above canopy ). 
 
percent light available = ( Light below shade / Light above shade ).</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Sampling for E042</para></listitem><listitem><para>Thirty seven old fields were surveyed for above and below ground biomass, soil nitrogen and light penetration. These fields include the ones used in experiment 14 (see E014), field D and 13 succession strips. In the succession strips, samples were taken through each strip every 15m. In the old fields from E014, except fields A, B and C, samples were parallel to the transect lines of E014. The clip strips were halfway up the transects, with 2 outside the transects and 3 in between the transect lines, making 5 strips per field. In fields A, B, C and D, samples were taken from control macroplots (E004). Five sample strips were taken from each field. In field A (29), two sample strips were taken from plots 1 and 6 and 1 strip from plot 9. In field B (22), two samples were taken from plots 2 and 3 and 1 strip from plot 5. In field C (69), three strips were taken from plot 3 and two strips from plot 5. In field D (6), two samples were taken from plots 1 and 4 and 1 strip from plot 5. Five strips, 1m x 10cm, were clipped in each field for above ground biomass. This was sorted to grasses and forbs. Three root cores, down to 30cm, were taken from each of the five strips in each of the 37 fields. These cores were rinsed, dried and weighed. Two light measurements and one pooled (3 cores, down 10cm deep) soil nitrogen sample (for available and total N) were taken per strip. 
 
Thirty five abundant species of known successional status were harvested from the field (usually 15 individuals per species), including roots contained in a core 20cm x 30 cm, dried, sorted to stem, leaf, and root, and weighed. Root cores were taken from microplots in fields A, B, C and D (E001), all treatments. This was an estimate of root biomass.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para></description></methodStep></methods><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>e042_Plant  biomass allocation</entityName><physical scope="document"><objectName>e042_Plant  biomass allocation.txt</objectName><size unit="rows">693</size><characterEncoding>ASCCII</characterEncoding><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><numFooterLines>0</numFooterLines><recordDelimiter>\r</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>\t</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution id="dist_knb-lter-cdr." scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://metacat.lternet.edu/das/dataAccessServlet?docid=knb-lter-cdr.&amp;urlTail=lno_data_request.php?input=rppe042</url></online><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=CDR,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></distribution></physical><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Field number/letter</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Field number/letter</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Field number/letter</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Experiment number</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Experiment number</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Experiment number</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Sampling year</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Sampling year</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><dateTime><formatString>YYYY</formatString></dateTime></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Species Taxon code</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Code specific to unique species or category samples have been seperated into</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Code specific to unique species or category samples have been seperated into</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Plant height (cm)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Plant height (cm)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>centimeter</standardUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Total biomass (g/plant)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Total biomass (g/plant)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>gram</standardUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Leaf biomass (g/plant)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Leaf biomass (g/plant)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>gram</standardUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Stem biomass (g/plant)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Stem biomass (g/plant)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>gram</standardUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Root biomass (g/plant)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Root biomass (g/plant)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>gram</standardUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Reproductive biomass (g/plant)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Reproductive biomass (g/plant)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>gram</standardUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList></dataTable></dataset><additionalMetadata><metadata><ns2:unitList convention="CML" /></metadata></additionalMetadata></ns0:eml>
