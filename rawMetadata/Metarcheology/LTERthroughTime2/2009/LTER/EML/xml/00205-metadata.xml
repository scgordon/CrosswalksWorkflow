The data are from the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) reference meteorological station.  As part of the LTER program, BES includes research on hydrology, vegetation, social factors affecting urban environment, climatology, air quality, and wildlife.  The reference station was installed at the McDonogh School in Owings Mills, MD, within the 30-km-long Gwynns Falls Watershed in April 2000.  The Gwynns Falls Watershed is the focus of the majority of BES research.  The variables measured at the reference station include all those in LTER Climate Committee Standards for Level 3 Meteorology: air temperature and humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, total solar radiation, incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), reflected PAR, atmospheric pressure, soil temperature at two depths, and volumetric soil moisture.  Net all-wave radiation and soil heat flux are also measured.  The reference station is in a relatively open location in a pasture field.  For most variables, both hourly averages and maximum and minimum values were measured.  Only average values are included in this data set.  Maximum and minimum values are available from the author on special request.

<geographicDescription>The Baltimore Ecosystem Study ultimately will conduct research and educational activities throughout the Baltimore metropolitan area. This large area includes Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and the counties of Ann Arundel, Carrol, Harford, Howard, and Montgomery. Gwynns Falls includes agricultural lands, recently suburbanized areas, established suburbs, and dense urban areas having residential, commercial and open spaces. In addition, a reference area has been established in a forested catchment of the Gunpowder drainage in Oregon Ridge County Park. </geographicDescription>
