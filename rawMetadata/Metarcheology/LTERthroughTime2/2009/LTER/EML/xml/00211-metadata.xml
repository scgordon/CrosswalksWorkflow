<abstract><para>
80 100 square meter plots located randomly throughout the uplands. were sampled similarly to the riparian sampling.  GIS was used to identify latitude and longitude for each plot, and plots were located in the field using GPS.  In each 100 square meter plot, all trees greater than or equal to 2.5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were identified to species and measured.  All stems less than 2..5 cm DBH and greater than or equal to 1 m in height were counted.  Four 1 square meter plots were established around the plot center, where percent cover of herbaceous species and species of woody seedlings were estimated using a 1 square meter frame divided into a grid of 100 10 square meter cells.

<geographicDescription>The Baltimore Ecosystem Study ultimately will conduct research and educational activities throughout the Baltimore metropolitan area. This large area includes Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and the counties of Ann Arundel, Carrol, Harford, Howard, and Montgomery. Gwynns Falls includes agricultural lands, recently suburbanized areas, established suburbs, and dense urban areas having residential, commercial and open spaces. In addition, a reference area has been established in a forested catchment of the Gunpowder drainage in Oregon Ridge County Park. </geographicDescription>
