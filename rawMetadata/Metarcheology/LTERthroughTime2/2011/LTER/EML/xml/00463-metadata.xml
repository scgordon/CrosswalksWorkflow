      <para> *We have hypothesized that large rhizobial population densities can
 occur at considerable depths in woody legume systems where deep
 moisture also occurs. However, associated with deep soil
 environments are low concentrations of soil nutrients that might
 affect nodulation and also limit survival of free-living rhizobia.
 The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if results from a
 previous study of a mesquite woodland utilizing groundwater in the
 Californian Sonoran desert were generizable to mesquite systems in
 other deserts where root depth varied with ecosystem type and (2)
 examine possible relationships of soil properties and host-plant
 phenology to rhizobial concentrations.
 Data set contains total nitrogen, total phosphorous,NH4-N, NO3-N,
 PO4-P, percent moisture, total roots, tap roots, fine roots,
 vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza, rhizobia Most Probable Number, and
 Rhizobia log (1+MPN).</para>

      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout> *Undisturbed soil cores from the rooting zone of three trees in each
 ecosystem were removed using a split steel, continuous sampling
 tube, 1.56 m long with 6.5 cm i.d. This coring device, mounted on a
 truck, was modified from Kelley et al. (1947). The split-tube
 bit fits into an outer, rotating auger bit that served as a
 continuous casing to prevent cave-in. As the outer bit cut through
 the soil, the inner, nonrotating bit was pressed into the soil.
 Cores were collected at the edge of the mesquite canopy. The core
 retainer and the two halves of the split sampling tube were cleaned
 of all residual soil. Their interior surface was flame sterilized
 with 95% ethanol before being put together for sampling. Soil
 samples were removed from the surface 1 m of soil in 0.5 m
 increments, and thereafter in 1 m increments. Flame sterilized
 trowels and spatulas were used to replace each depth increment into
 a clean plastic bag. These were put into icecooled chests, and
 transported to the Univ. of California, Riverside, where they were
 subdivided for analysis. Drilling depth for each core was
 determined by either the absence of roots in two consecutive 1.56 m
 sampling tube lengths, or the presence of coarse, dry loose soil
 that could not be retained in the tube. The number of cores (three
 per ecosystem per sampling) collected was limited by the expense of
 obtaining the specialized drilling equipment used in this study.
 Sampling dates at New Mexico were in January 1986, the midpoint of
 the dormant season; late May 1986, during peak growth; and early
 October 1986 following the summer rains. The grassland site was not
 sampled on the Jan-Feb drillings.

 Each bag of soil representing a depth increment was mixed thoroughly
 before subsampling. Using trowels and spatulas flame sterilized with
 95% ethanol, each soil sample was sub-divided for various analyses.
 Gravimetric water content of the soil samples was determined at the
 time of subsampling(weight of water/weight of dry soil). Soils for
 chemical analysis were then air-dried in a glass-house, ground to
 break-up clay and caliche aggregates, and passed through a 2 mm
 sieve. Potassium chloride-extractable NH4-N and NO3-N (Keeney and
 Nelson, 1982) and NaHCO3-extractable P (Olsen and Dean 1965) were
 measured colorimetrically using a technicon Auto analyzer (technicon
 Instruments Corp). Roots were separated from field-moist soil
 without sieving by flotation using an elutriator fitted with a 20
 mesh seive (Byrd et al. 1976). Fall soil Total Kjeldahl N, Total P,
 NH4-N and NO3-N analyses were done on field moist soils rather than
 dried soil. Total N (and Total P) was digested by Kjeldahl
 digestion block techniques (Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982). Digest
 NH4-N was analyzed using an automated salicylate procedure
 (Technicon Industrial Method No. 329-74W/B).

 Concentrations of mesquite-nodulating rhizobia in field-moist soil
 samples were estimated using the plant-infection, most
 probable-number (MPN) technique (Vincent 1970). Tenfold dilutions
 (10 -1 to 10 -6), starting with 10 g of subsmple in 90mL of sterile,
 buffered saline (0.15 M NaCl, 0.002 M KH2PO4, 0.004 M Na2HPO4, pH
 7), and four replicate mesquite plants per dilution, were used for
 the MPN tests. Mesquite seedlings were germinated from seed
 collected from the Jornada. Seeds were surface sterilized and
 scarified by exposure to concentrated sulfuric acid for 3 min
 followed by six washes in sterile, distilled water. One sterilized
 seed was planted in sterile vericulite contained in plant tubes
 (Garvin and Lindemann 1983). The plant tubes had been sterilized
 with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite and rinsed thoroughly in sterile
 water. Each mesquite seedling was inoculated with 1 mL of an
 appropraite soil dilution. After inoculation, the plants were
 randomized, and grown in a glasshouse where temperatures ranged from
 25 to 35 C under natural lighting conditions. During winter,
 supplemental light (cool-white flourescent lamps) situated 1 m above
 the plants was provided to maintain a 14-h daylength. On alternate
 days the plants were irrigated with sterile, 0.25 strength
 Hoagland's nutrient solution lacking N. Noninoculated plants served
 as controls. Plants were grown for 6 to 8 weeks before they were
 examined for nodulation. The MPN for each sample was calculated
 using Table 3.5A in Vincent (1970).</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
