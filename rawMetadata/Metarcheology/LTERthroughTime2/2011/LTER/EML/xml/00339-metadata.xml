    <section>
      <para> The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not
 the activities of small mammals regulate plant community
 structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation
 patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What
 role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in
 maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert?
 Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with
 changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This
 study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of
 consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal
 climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be
 addressed.

 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species
 composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and
 spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass
 in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small
 mammals keystone species that determine plant species
 composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert
 communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al.
 (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role
 in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial
 heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities?

 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and
 spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in
 grassland communities as compared to shrub communities?
 How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland
 sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns
 relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns?

 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and
 long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal
 changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species
 composition?

      <literalLayout> The Sevilleta LTER site is located at the US Fish and
 Wildlife Service, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central
 New Mexico (Figure 1). The Sevilleta is located at 34 north
 latitude, and the grasslands and shrublands are at about 1,550
 meters in elevation. The grassland and shrubland areas have long-
 term mean annual precipitation of about 280 mm and mean annual
 temperature of about 13 C. The Sevilleta is predominantly black
 grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis)
 grassland, with less extensive creosotebush shrub communities.
 The Jornada LTER site is located at the US Department of
 Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental
 Range in southern New Mexico (Figure 1). The Jornada is located
 at 32 north latitude, and the grasslands and shrublands are at
 about 1,300 meters elevation. The long-term mean annual
 precipitation is 230 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 15 C.
 The Jornada is primarily creosotebush and mesquite (Prosopis
 glandulosa) shrubland with less extensive black grama grass
 communities. The grassland site is one kilometer west of the
 IBPE grassland site, and the creosotebush site is three kilo-
 meters southeast of the lower trailer.

      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout> Experimental Design
 -------------------
 A creosotebush shrub study site and a black grama grassland
 study site have been established at both the Jornada and
 Sevilleta, for a total of four study sites. The study sites were
 subjectively chosen to represent typical creosotebush shrub and
 black grama grassland communities on lower bajada or peidmont
 slopes at both the Jornada and Sevilleta. The study sites are
 located in areas that are not grazed by domestic livestock
 (except the Jornada grassland site; see experimental design
 below), to eliminate the confounding effects of livestock on
 vegetation and soil.

 Each of the four study sites are approximately 1 km by 0.5
 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate
 experimental blocks of plots were randomly located at each of the
 four study sites to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion
 of small mammals (Figure 2). Treatments within each block include
 one unfenced control plot, one fenced plot to exclude rodents and
 rabbits, and one fenced plot to exclude rabbits only. The three
 treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible
 plots in each block independently. The Jornada grassland site is
 grazed by cattle, so an additional treatment plot of cattle
 fencing was randomly assigned to one plot in each of the four
 blocks. Each of the three or four plots in a replicate block are
 separated by 20 meters. Each block of plots is situated near a
 rodent trapping web. Distances between the four replicate blocks
 of plots at each study site varies among sites from 30 meters to
 800 meters, depending upon the random coordinates.

 Each block of experimental measurement plots consists of one
 unfenced control plot, and two (or three if cattle are present)
 fenced animal exclosure plots (Figure 2). Each experimental
 measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. A grid of 36
 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a
 systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A 3-
 meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points
 and the perimeter of each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-
 meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36
 points (Figure 3). The control plots are not fenced.

 One year of pre-treatment or pre-fencing measurement data
 will be collected in 1995 from all of the plots. Analysis of the
 pre-treatment data will reveal any differences between plots that
 are independent of the treatments. Fences will be constructed in
 the winter of 1995, and the long-term small mammal exclosure
 experiment will commence in spring of 1996.

 One set of exclosure plots will be fenced with three-foot
 high wire hardware cloth of 1/4-inch mesh size to exclude
 rodents, and four-foot high poultry-wire fencing of two-inch mesh
 size to exclude rabbits. The hardware cloth screen will be buried
 inches to prevent animals from burrowing underneath the fence.
 The four-foot high poultry-wire fence will be positioned inside
 of and flush with the screen fence to exclude rabbits from the
 plot. A six-inch wide strip of metal flashing will be placed
 along the top of the hardware cloth, and attached outside of the
 poultry-wire, to prevent rodents from climbing over the fences.
 Steel fence posts and reinforcing bar (rebar) will be used to
 support the fences.

 The second set of exclosure plots will be fenced with
 poultry-wire to exclude rabbits, but not rodents. Two-inch
 diameter poultry-wire mesh will allow access for all local rodent
 species at each site. A four-foot high poultry-wire fence will be
 positioned around the perimeter of each plot to exclude rabbits.
 Steel fence posts and rebar will be used to support the fences.

 Fencing with hardware cloth and poultry wire will impede the
 ground surface movement of organic litter. Rainfall runoff
 transports plant litter in ground-surface sheet-flow, and in
 small ephemeral surface drainages or rills. To alleviate the
 problem of fences interfering with transport, litter
 accumulations on the up-slope sides of fences will be manually
 removed and lifted over the fences once every two months. This
 procedure will allow for the natural movement of soil surface
 organic materials on to and off of the fenced plots.

 Litter catchment screens made of hardware cloth and poultry
 wire will be placed in all small drainages crossing the up-slope
 perimeters of each plot, including the unfenced control plots.
 Litter caught on the screens will be manually lifted over the
 fences of treatment plots, and placed just across the perimeters
 of control plots. Use of catchment screens should allow normal
 litter transport in rills onto and off of the plots. Use of
 catchment screens on the control plots will account for
 differences in water flow that the screens might create on the
 fenced plots.

 Cattle are present (one-month low intensity winter grazing)
 at the Jornada black grama grassland site. Barbed-wire strands
 will be added to the rodent and rabbit, and rabbit only exclosure
 fences to exclude cattle from those plots. Additionally, a fourth
 measurement plot was added to each replicate block that will be
 fenced with barbed-wire to exclude cattle only to measure cattle
 effects on vegetation and soil. The cattle exclosure treatment is
 not intended to be part of the overall experimental design, but
 rather a way a accommodate for the presence of cattle at the
 site. There are no ungrazed black grama grassland sites at the
 Jornada that are large enough in area to support the small mammal
 exclosure study.


 The same experimental design is proposed for the Mapimi
 research site, except that a creosotebush study site and a tabosa
 grassland study site will be installed instead of creosotebush
 and black grama grassland sites as at Sevilleta and Jornada.
 Tabosa is the dominant grassland at Mapimi, and no black grama
 grasslands occur at Mapimi. Additionally, the Mapimi site is
 grazed by cattle, so a fourth cattle exclosure plot will be
 included in each block of plots at the creosotebush and tabosa
 grassland study sites.

 Rodent trapping webs are being used to determine the
 composition of rodent species at each study site, and to estimate
 densities of each species over time. The use of webs and distance
 measures to estimate rodent densities is statistically more
 robust than grid plot sampling and mark-release indices (Anderson
 et al. 1983, Buckland et al. 1993). Each rodent trapping web
 consists of a series of 12 equally spaced lines radiating from a
 central point. Each line consists of 12 trap stations. The first
 trap station is located 5 meters from the center, the next three
 at 5 meter intervals, and the remaining 8 at ten meter intervals.
 Each trap line is 100 meters long, and each web is 200 meters in
 diameter. The above rodent trapping web design has been used for
 six years at the Sevilleta LTER, and has recently been adopted by
 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as a standard
 technique for monitoring rodent populations.

 Small Mammals
 -------------
 Rodent populations will be sampled from each of the three
 webs at each of the study sites twice each year, in the early
 (April-May) and late (September-October) summer. Sherman (H. B.
 Sherman Traps, Inc., Tallahassee, FL) live-traps are left open
 for three consecutive nights, and captured animals are recorded
 for three consecutive mornings. Each animal caught is identified,
 measured, and released at the same location where it was
 captured. Each animal is temporarily marked with a marking pen to
 determine recapture status for a given three-night sampling
 period. No permanent marking techniques are used. Rodent trapping
 is conducted at all 6 webs at a given research site over the same
 3 night period. Rodent trapping at the Sevilleta, Jornada, and
 Mapimi will be conducted at the same time of year.

 Persons working with rodents in the field will follow safety
 guidelines developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and
 Prevention (Mills, et al. in press), to reduce exposure to
 hantavirus, plague, and other rodent-vectored diseases.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha 
                         Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State
