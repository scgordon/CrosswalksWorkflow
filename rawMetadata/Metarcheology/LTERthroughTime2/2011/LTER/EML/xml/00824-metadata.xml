Forest floor samples were randomly collected along 4 transects at each site; in Sept 1994 there were 4 locations per transect and in 1995 2 locations per transect were sampled.  Transects extended 10 m from the original 40 &#215; 20 m terrestrial gradient plot and were located along the 40 m side of the plot.  Samples were collected using a 30 &#215; 30 cm frame.  All forest floor within the 0.09 m2 frame was separated into L, F, and H layers; these layers correspond to Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons as described in soil taxonomy.  Forest floor was dried at 60&#176; C in a forced air oven to a constant weight.  Samples were then weighed to the nearest 0.1g.  Forest floor samples were composited for C &amp; N analysis by transect for each date.  Total percent C and N were determined by combustion on a ground subsample using a Perkin Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer. Note that only C &amp; N data from 1995 are available.</para></section></samplingDescription><spatialSamplingUnits><referencedEntityId>1122.kml</referencedEntityId></spatialSamplingUnits></sampling></methods><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta LTER Program V</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><givenName>L</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><givenName>Barrie</givenName><surName>Collins</surName></individualName><role>informationManager</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. The current interdisciplinary research integrates ecological and socioeconomic components across 54,000 km2 of the southern Appalachian Mountains, a biogeophysical and socioeconomic region in which evolutionary and historical processes converge (Whittaker 1956, Markusen 1987, Barnes 1991, Kretzschmar et al. 1993, Bailey 1996). Our research objective in 2002-2008 is to advance scientific understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years. Our guiding hypothesis is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in response to socioeconomic and biogeophysical conditions with consequences that cascade through ecosystems.</para></abstract><funding><para>This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number OCE-9982133.
