      <para>This project was designed to investigate the response of plant growth  and reproduction to short- and long-term variation in biotic and  abiotic environmental variables.  Several perennial taxa, including tree  (Juniperus monsperma and Pinus edulis), shrub (Larrea tridentata) and bunch grasses (Oryzopsis hymenoides (now Achnaterum hymenoides) and Sporobolus contractus)  species, were monitored at 1-3 sites differing in elevation and  topography as well as edaphic variables and annual precipitation.  The  sites represented optimal or marginal/transitional zones for particular  species.  Demographic measurements were made biannually, after the 'wet'  (fall) and 'dry' (spring) seasons.  For tree and shrub species,  estimates of growth and reproduction were based on branch demography,  with ten branch tips from 10-20 individuals per species per site  repeatedly measured from 1989-1993.&#160;  For J. monsperma, P. edulis and L. tridentata,  vegetative growth (i.e., branch growth) as well as reproduction were  monitored. Additional measurements included needle length for P. edulis and leaf production, leaf size and branchlet production for L. tridentata.  For grasses, basal diameter, leaf length and reproduction were monitored for 100 individuals per species per site. This project, SEV026, contains only data on creosote branch demography.&#160;  Data on other variables and species is contained in SEV006, SEV024, SEV025, SEV027, and SEV028.</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR, flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites. Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site as the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location of Met Station 44. The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power lines.&#160; An earthen berm stops road travel here and the met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road. &#160; Vegetation: The Rio Salado Grassland site is Plains-Mesa Sand Scrub habitat characterized by
stabilized deep-sand dominated by coppice dunes of honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa). Co-dominant shrubs are sand sagebrush (Artemesia filifolia) and
fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), with winterfat (Krascheninnikovia
lanata), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), broom indigobush (Psorothamnus
scoparius), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia
sarothrae) as other notable shrubs. One-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) is
present as well, especially along shallow washes. Compared to the Black Grama
Core Site, grass cover is sparse and dominated by poverty threeawn (Aristida
divaricata), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), mesa and spike dropseed
(Sporobolus cryptandrus and S. contractus), as well as patches of black grama
(Bouteloua eriopoda). Notable forbs included spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa
wislizenii), tansy aster (Machaeranthera tanacetifolia), desert marigold
(Baileya multiradiata), Abert buckwheat (Eriogonum abertianum), dwarf gilia
(Ipomopsis pumila), rattlesnake weed (Chamaesyce albomarginata), blunt
tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala),
and Rocky Mountain zinnia (Zinnia grandiflora)., siteid: 13</geographicDescription>

While individual creosote bushes tend to be larger, overall plant cover is less than at the creosote core site at Five Points, with more exposed embedded stones and gravel on the soil surface, creating a pavement-like appearance., </geographicDescription>

File complete and archived 21 December 1990; Michelle Murillo and Greg Shore. Documentation changed to reflect changes in datafile structure; 1 March 91 T. Maddux.II. Detailed log of alterations/modifications of plant demography data:     This portion of the log contains details of all alterations and modifications applied to this file by Michelle Murillo. The file demography.dat was initiated in September 1990 by concatenating individual files into the demography.dat file. A generic header was devised to apply to all individual files. The header reads as such:date season site species station plant# branch# #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 #8and the detailed description of the numbers 1-8 are listed in the documentation section of this file. The individual files were then modified to follow this header, which entailed rearranging of columns (generally the season, site, species, station, plant#, and branch#) and the addition of the date column.  As the columns numbered 1-8 did not pertain to all individual files,  non-applicables (na) were inserted where necessary. Other alterations included:1. juniper 1989: Sepultura Canyon; addition of na's to presence/absence                       of male or female cones, depending on sex of tree, i.e.                      if tree was female then na's were inserted in the male                      column                      Goat Draw; same as Sepultura Canyon2. juniper 1990: (Sepultura Canyon site has been discontinued)                      Goat Draw (season 1); orginal file contained x,y and --'s;                      which were converted to 0 (absence) and 1 (presence)                      and appropriate na's were inserted, depending on                      sex of tree                      Goat Draw (season 2); orginal file contained +'s for                       presence of cones; which were converted to 1 (presence)                      and appropriate na's were inserted depending on sex of tree.NOTE: In 1989 width of branch was measured, and in 1990 this measurement               was no longer taken. (The orginal data sheets for 1989-2 are                unavailable at the time of archiving, assumption is that this                measurement applies to season 2 also).  In 1990 the length of                branchlet was measured which was not measured in 1989. (See                documentation).NOTE: In 1989 (both seasons) the variable, number of branchlets, was               not included. In 1990 the variable was added, but measurements               of this variable was sporadic, occuring only in a few plants.3. grasses 1989/1990: All sites: addition of na's to branch#Error checking was done as follows: Two files, grasses 1990-season 1, and creosote 1990-season 1, had not been entered at the time of concatenation of individual files, and were therefore entered by Michelle Murillo. These two files were errored checked by Michelle Murillo by visual checking of original data sheets with the files on 18 December 1990. On 17 December 1990, the expand program was applied to the demography.dat file and placed into the demography.rdb file. The rdb file was then checked for various errors, and the elimination of these errors were completed on 18 December 1990. On 19-20 December 1990, random error checking was conducted by using 'Tables for Statistical Data-Analysis'. One hundred and fifty entries were checked and approximiately 45 percent of the numbers were from 1989-season 2, and because the data sheets were unavailable, the entries were not error checked. On 23 December 1990, visual checking with the original data sheets was conducted for an overall check.File initiated June 1991: MLM season 1 entered: MLM season 2 entered: KPM Black Butte, season 2 entered and error checked, 7 Jan 1992: MLM data entry complete 25 October 1991:  KPM data error checking completed 8 November 1991:  KPM 	Documentation updated (New people and times added) on 29 Jan 1992 and inserted into data file by Troy Maddux. 1992 log 	* Put the 1992 data in the data base on 22 Oct 1992 	  Troy Maddux.THE FOLLOWING IS THE LOG FOR THE SPRING 1992 DEMOGRAPHY DATA: File initiated by Troy Maddux 24 Aug 1992.

          <para>
            <literalLayout>Plant Selection - One hundred Larrea tridentata individuals were selected and numbered.  Twenty individuals were randomly selected for measurement. Branch Selection - Ten branches were numbered consecutively around each shrub to cover all exposures. Tag Placement - Tags were placed about five centimeters from the tip of the branch at a node where the branch forked. Branches were also marked at that point with a paint pen so each tag could be tied loosely, thereby not restricting vascular flow.If a tagged branch died the tag was placed on another branch using  the same number with a ".1" suffix.  For example if branch 4 was found  dead, another branch was marked 4.1.  If, in subsequent seasons, 4.1 was  found dead another branch was marked&#160;4.2. &#160;Plant Measurement:1. Branch Length - This is the length from tag to tip of branch.  If a tag was loose it was moved back toward the plant until stopped&#160; by a node where two branches diverged.  A paint mark indicated this location.  If a paint mark was elsewhere then measurement was done from the paint mark and it was noted on the data sheet that the paint mark was not at a branching point.2. Leaf - This is the number of leaves between tag (or tag mark) and tip of branch.  Creosote has compound leaves so two leaflets usually comprised one leaf.  If one leaflet was missing the leaf was still counted as one.  If leaf status was uncertain, the petiole or point of attachment to the stem was used as verification.3. Leaf Length1 - This is the length of one leaf on a tagged branch. This measurement was considered to be the length of the blade of one leaflet NOT including the petiole.4. Leaf Length2 - This is the same measurement as Leaf Length1 performed on a different leaf.5. Bud - The number of buds between the tag (or tag mark) and the tip of the branch.6. Flower - The number of flowers between the tag (or tag mark) and the tip of the branch.7. Fruit - The number of fruits between the tag (or tag mark) and the tip of the branch.8. Branchlet - The number of branchlets between the tag (or tag mark) and the tip of the branch.</literalLayout>
