      <para>This data set contains information regarding carnivore scat surveys that were performed at sites in grama grassland and both creosote and mesquite shrubland habitats at the Sevilleta NWR. A total of six surveys were carried out along 22 road-based transects, each of which is a mile long, during three seasons in 2009: spring (April-May), summer (July-August), and fall (October-November). There were 12 transects in grassland areas and 10 in shrubland areas. For more information on the structure of the vegetation surrounding these road based transects, see the "Vegetation surveys in grassland and shrubland sites that are associated with coyote scat surveys at the Sevilleta NWR, spring, summer and fall 2009" data set. Scat samples were identified in the field and collected for genetic and stable carbon isotope analysis. Field recorded variables include: scat freshness, maximum diameter, length, and GPS coordinates, as well as the field-based species identification for the sample. Information on the lab based species and individual identification results are also presented.</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: McKenzie Flats is located within the northeastern section of the Sevilleta NWR, encompassing an area from Black Butte south  to Palo Duro Canyon and east to the Los Pinos.Landform: McKenzie Flats is a broad, nearly flat grassland plain between the Los Pinos Mountains and the breaks on the east side of the Rio Grande., Geology: Deep (20,000 ft) alluvial and aeolian deposits., Soils: Turney Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Calciorthids.  Berino Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids., Hydrology: Surface water only during rain events, no arroyos.  Run-on plain for Los Pinos Mountains., Vegetation: The terrain is generally a mixed-species desert grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), blue grama (B. gracilis), sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola), various drop seeds and sacatons (Sporobolus spp.), purple three-awn (Aristida purpurea), and burrow grass (Scleropogon brevifolia).  Shrubs are common in the area around Five Points, including creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)., Climate: Long-term mean annual precipitation is 243 mm, about 60% of which occurs during the summer.  Long-term mean monthly temperatures for January and July are 1.5 degrees C and 25.1 degrees C, respectively., History: McKenzie Flats encompasses an area of approximately 50 square miles and was one of the primary livestock grazing areas within what is now the Sevilleta NWR.  Cattle have been excluded from the site since 1974-76.  The ranch headquarters buildings and corrals were located at the junction of Legs C and D of the coyote survey.  , siteid: 25</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral  tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR,  flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and  Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and  ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites.  Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although  rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site  because the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are  co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location Met Station 44.The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power 	lines.&#160;  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the 	met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.&#160;Vegetation: The Rio Salado Larrea site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), with honey mesquite, fourwing saltbush, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra), and broom snakeweed as co-occurring shrubs. Dominant grasses are black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), and fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum). Common forb species include desert holly (Acourtia nana), spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa spp.), blackfoot daisey (Melampodium leucanthum), twinleaf (Senna bauhinoides), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala). While individual creosote bushes tend to be larger, overall plant cover is less than at the creosote core site at Five Points, with more exposed embedded stones and gravel on the soil surface, creating a pavement-like appearance., </geographicDescription>

        <section>
          <para>
            <literalLayout>&#160;Experimental Design:&#160;Carnivore scat surveys were carried out along roads located in grassland and shrubland habitats throughout the Sevilleta NWR. Surveys were done along 22 road based transects. 12 transects were located in grassland areas (10 in 2008) and 10 in shrubland areas.Sampling Design:&#160;Each scat transect was 1 mile long and was separated from all other transects by at least 1 mile to ensure independence of scat samples collected on different transects. In 2008, each transect was surveyed three times between June 24th and July &#160;24th, 2008. Each transect was surveyed a total of&#160;six times between April 13th and November 6th, 2009. More specifically, two surveys were carried out in each of three seasons: spring (April-May 2009); summer (July-August 2009); and fall (October-November 2009).Field Methods:&#160;The beginning and end points of each scat transect were marked at the beginning of the spring field season with a wooden stake and a pin flag so that each of the six surveys was carried out along the same road segments. The end points of three transects (D,E, and R) were moved slightly from their original locations in summer, 2008 and two transects were added (U and V). The coordinates of all of these new locations were determined via GPS and recorded. Before the first scat survey in each season, all transects were cleared of all visible carnivore scat. During each of the two subsequent surveys in each season, each complete carnivore scat sample encountered was measured and collected. A sample was considered to be incomplete if it were clearly torn or very small and likely missing part of the sample. When clearing transects and conducting surveys, the transects were driven in a field vehicle (truck) at 5-10mph and the driver looked through both the windshield and front windows for scat samples. When a particular item could not be identified from within the truck, the driver would get out of the vehicle and investigate the item further. When a carnivore scat sample was encountered, a photograph was taken and the GPS coordinates for the location of the scat were recorded. If the scat was composed of multiple pieces that were spread out along the road, then an attempt was made to record the GPS coordinates of a point midway between the two pieces that were furthest apart. If the scat was not flattened or otherwise degraded, two measurements of maximum diameter and one measurement of length were recorded. When a scat contained multiple pieces, these measurements were generally taken on the longest piece. If part of the scat was flattened, then measurements were taken on the longest, unflattened piece. Maximum diameter was measured using&#160;calipers and length was measured using a clear, plastic ruler. Once the measurements were taken, small pieces of the scat were removed using flame sterilized tweezers and placed in a 2mL plastic tube containing DET buffer. The buffer preserved the samples for future genetic analysis. The remainder of the sample was then collected in a ziplock bag for future drying and carbon isotope analysis.Laboratory Procedures:&#160;All scat samples were dried for 24 hours at 70 degrees Celsius and, in future, will be prepared and run through a stable carbon isotope analysis in a coupled element analyzer and mass spectrometer. Small subsamples of each scat will be run through a mitochondrial DNA species test. All samples identified as coyotes in this test will then be run through a microsatellite analysis, with 8 loci, to identify individuals.</literalLayout>
