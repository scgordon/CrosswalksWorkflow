    <section>
      <para>We evaluated the effects of a lightning-initiated fire on responses of vegetation communities. Following a fire in July 1998, 25 experimental plots were established on the eastern edge of MacKenzie Flats at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Ten of these plots were located in a Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama)- dominated site, while 15 were established in another area dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama). We evaluated basal and aerial cover of all plant species at the community level using a vertical line point intercept method along transects within plots. Sampling was conducted immediately after the fire during the last week of July 1998, and again in September and October of 2001.</para>

    <geographicCoverage>
      <geographicDescription>Location: McKenzie Flats is located within the northeastern section of the Sevilleta NWR, encompassing an area from Black Butte south  to Palo Duro Canyon and east to the Los Pinos.Landform: McKenzie Flats is a broad, nearly flat grassland plain between the Los Pinos Mountains and the breaks on the east side of the Rio Grande., Geology: Deep (20,000 ft) alluvial and aeolian deposits., Soils: Turney Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Calciorthids.  Berino Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids., Hydrology: Surface water only during rain events, no arroyos.  Run-on plain for Los Pinos Mountains., Vegetation: The terrain is generally a mixed-species desert grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), blue grama (B. gracilis), sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola), various drop seeds and sacatons (Sporobolus spp.), purple three-awn (Aristida purpurea), and burrow grass (Scleropogon brevifolia).  Shrubs are common in the area around Five Points, including creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)., Climate: Long-term mean annual precipitation is 243 mm, about 60% of which occurs during the summer.  Long-term mean monthly temperatures for January and July are 1.5 degrees C and 25.1 degrees C, respectively., History: McKenzie Flats encompasses an area of approximately 50 square miles and was one of the primary livestock grazing areas within what is now the Sevilleta NWR.  Cattle have been excluded from the site since 1974-76.  The ranch headquarters buildings and corrals were located at the junction of Legs C and D of the coyote survey.  , siteid: 25</geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Experimental Design - Following a lightning-initiated fire in July 1998, 25 experimental plots were established on the eastern edge of MacKenzie Flats at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Ten of these plots were located in a Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama)-dominated site, while 15 were established in another area dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama). In the former site, five of the 10 plots were established in burned areas, and the others were positioned in unburned grassland vegetation. In the latter site, five plots were placed in burned areas, five were positioned in unburned grasslands, and the five remaining plots were located in an area that contained a mix of burned and unburned patches of grassland vegetation. Sampling Design - All of the plots in the Bouteloua gracilis-dominated site were 4 m x 16 m. Of the 25 plots where B. eriopoda was more abundant, nine were 4 m x 16 m and 16 were 4 m x 25 m. Regardless of site, all plots were oriented such that the long axis of each was parallel to a topographic gradient running east-west.We sampled vegetation responses on two separate occasions. An initial sampling was conducted immediately after the fire during the last week of July 1998, and a final sample was conducted in September and October of 2001. During each of the two samples periods, four parallel transects were randomly positioned along the long axis of each plot. In 4 m x 16 m plots, transects were 12  m long, and 125 pins were vertically dropped every 10 cm along each transect. Transects were 25 m long in 4 x 25 m plots, and 125 pins were dropped every 20 cm along each transect. Field Methods - Along each transect, vegetation community data were collected using the vertical point transect method (Bonham 1989). At each pin drop, all species that intercepted the pin were recorded in the order in which they were encountered from vegetation canopy to ground level. Additionally, we noted if a pin directly hit a plant species, bare ground, or litter.</literalLayout>
