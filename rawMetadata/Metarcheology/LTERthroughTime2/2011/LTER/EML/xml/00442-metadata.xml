    <section>
      <para> The phenological stage of all perennial plant species on the 15
 NPP sites is recorded on a monthly basis. This allows us to track
 the influence of weather and of site differences on plant reproduction.
 The boundaries of the (80m x 80m) study plot are walked and each
 individual plant of any perennial species in a 1-m belt is examined
 and its phenology noted (non-reproductive, in bud, in flower, in fruit,
 or dormant).</para>

      <literalLayout> Phenology transects run along the 5 meter buffer on the west and
 south sides (80m x 80m) of the 15 NPP sites. Transects that begin
 at the SE (southeast) corner extend to the SW (southwest) corner and
 then to the NW (northwest) corner. Transects that begin at the NW
 (northwest) corner extend to the SW (southwest) corner and then to the
 SE (southeast) corner. The exception is P-COLL site where there is no
 buffer because of the LTER-I transects on west and east sides. The
 phenology transect begins at the SE corner (NPP Quad 16) and extends
 to Quad 1 at the NE corner, then to Quad 37 at the NW corner.

      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

Please send 1 copy of any publication that cites Jornada Basin LTER data to:

            <literalLayout> Each of the 15 NPP plots is to be monitored monthly (done as near to the
 15th day of each month as possible) for the phenological condition of
 perennial grasses and woody plants. This monitoring will result in counts
 of plants in each of several states, from which percentages can be
 calculated.

 Sampling is done along the west and south side of each NPP plot by walking
 along the outside of the plot with the center of a meter stick held
 perpendicular to an imaginary line that connects all the buffer zone
 corner posts. Exceptions: there are no buffers at the three playa sites
 or at M-NORT, or along the south side of G-SUMM. On these sites the S and
 W boundaries of the NPP plot itself are walked with the 100cm end of the
 meter stick touching the outside of the rebar. At P-COLL the E and N
 boundaries of the NPP plot itself are walked. In January 2001 there
 was a change in methodology at P-TOBO; the E and S boundaries are
 walked.

 All perennial grasses, shrubs and subshrubs species falling within this 1
 meter wide belt will be tallied in one of the following categories:
 dormant, non-reproductive (non-rep), in bud, fully open flowers, mature
 fruits. The most advanced phenological stage present is the one recorded;
 a plant is considered to be in flower (for example), if there is at least
 one open flower present (even if the majority of flowers are in the bud
 stage).

 Tallies are to be done in the dot-box method, where each individual is
 tallied as either a dot or line; 4 dots from corners of a box, and
 additional counts are represented as lines joining the corners and forming
 2 diagonals (completed box with diagonals = count of 10). Each species in
 a site will have its own line on the data sheet.

 The following grass species are considered "path-forming" species: BOER,
 MUPO, and PLMU. For these species, the entire patch is considered a
 single tally. A patch is defined as a contiguous area of overlapping
 vegetation with no easily discernable distinctions between basal units
 when viewed from above.

 Certain species of grasses are present in large numbers at some sites.
 These grasses are measured along a line intercept, as opposed to a belt
 transect, running between the S and W buffer zone rebars. Each patch or
 individual of these species that contacts the line is tallied. This
 method applies to the following grasses at the following sites:

 BOER - all sites
 DAPU - M-RABB, C-CALI, and C-SAND
 MUAR - T-TAYL
 PLMU - P-TOBO
 SCBR - G-BASN, T-EAST, T-TAYL, T-WEST
 SPAI - P-TOBO

 At two playa sites where PAOB is found in dense stands, each square meter
 (using the meter stick) along the line was checked for reproductive state
 rather than the entire line being counted as one. This resulted in high
 counts of 170 at P-COLL and 140 at P-SMAL. As counts are essential for
 data analysis, a count is obtained for each plant even when all plants of
 a species are in a single state rather than just "all" being recorded.

 In addition to reproductive phenology, information on dates of leaf drop
 or dormancy in those species which are not green over the winter (or in
 drought periods) is recorded. Those individuals which have dropped leaves
 or otherwise appear to be dormant, i.e. grass with no visible green, are
 tallied in the "dormant" column. If everything is dormant, phenology is
 not recorded or read to minimize traffic.

 In certain seasons seedlings are present in large numbers. A separate
 tally for seedlings should be made and recorded in the comments section
 on the data sheet. These individuals can be added to the total
 phenological counts once the plants have reached reproductive size.

 Certain species require specific instructions regarding method of
 tallying. At M-NORT and M-RABB, each mesquite dune is considered one PRGL
 tally. At the three tarbush sites and G-BASN, the dioecious grass SCBR
 is present; when determining phenology, flowering individuals must be
 male plants whereas fruiting individuals must be female plants.

 Note: Individual plant tally numbers will change from month to month as a
 person cannot walk the exact same transect line each census. Extra effort
 should be made not to miss individuals of species which are not abundant
 on a given transect to ensure useable data are collected. Often species
 abundance changes over time due to recruitment and senescence. If the
 line-transect method is used for a particular species (such as DAPU) and
 the number of individuals drops consistently to small numbers, it is
 appropriate to swith back to the belt transect method with approval from
 Laura Huenneke. All changes should be noted in the history log.

 Protocol for Documentation and Data Entry:

 1. Enter data into PLPHXXXX.xls immediately following field work
 (where XXXX represents data set year. Data entry should take less
 than 15 minutes. Remember to update header 'last updated' information.
 2. Save excel file and update NPPPhen.his if necessary. Remember to
 add update info at the end of the file. Save history file.
 3. Send both files to John Anderson for archiving. Any updates to
 history log or data file added between field days should be sent to John.
 4. At the end of the calendar year history log and excel files are
 sent to John and an ascii version of the data file should be created.
 a. In excel replace blank cells with periods. Highlight area
 where blanks should be replaced with zeros. Go to 'Edit' and
 'Replace.' Leave the 'Find What' cell blank and add a zero in
 the 'replace with' cell. Click Replace all. (This may not be
 available in more recent versions of excel.)
 b. Left align Column K. Select columns A through K (comment
 column) and copy.
 c. In KEDIT open new file. Paste excel columns. Make sure
 appropriate header and variable information is present. (see
 other *.dat files if in doubt.)
 d. Save as PLPHxxxx.dat (where XXXX represents data set year).
 e. Send ascii version to John.
 5. Take raw data sheets and bind them with purple cover
 sheets. PH_book_cover.doc contains the cover sheet file.
 6. Create new excel file for next calendar year (simply open
 old file, 'Save As' the new file year name, and delete old
 data points).</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha 
                         Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State 
                         University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is 
                         administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER 
                         Network, one of  more than 25 long term sites funded by the U.S. National Science 
                         Foundation.</literalLayout>
