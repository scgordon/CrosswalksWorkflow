      <para> Overview:
 In semiarid ecosystems the diversity of plant functional types (
 grasses, shrubs, succulents, and so on) and of species may interact
 with the severe stresses imposed by the desert environment to influence
 ecosystem processes. Erosion and transport of surface sediment by wind
 and water is one process that may be affected by the physical structure
 of the plant community. The Jornada plant diversity experiment, in
 which the diversity and structure of the plant community have been
 manipulated in large (25 m x 25 m) plots, offers the opportunity to
 examine the relative importance of vegetation characteristics and
 landscape position in determining rates of sediment movement within
 the plots.
 Each of the 48 plots of the plant diversity experiment contains
 5 pans or trays on the downslope side; these accumulate sediments and
 plant litter that are moving within the plots (carried by wind or by
 water). Data have been collected on the amount of sediment accumulated
 in the pans during rainy and during dry seasons, with material sorted
 and weighed as fine ( less than 2 mm diameter) or coarse  more than 2 mm) mineral sediment,
 plant litter, or rabbit/jackrabbit pellets. Previous statistical analyses
 found that the mass of material collected per plot is explained only poorly
 by the treatment (plant community manipulation) of the plot and by block
 (a rough indication of location on the slope).

 Objectives:
 We will test the relative significance of the following variables
 in explaining plot-level accumulations of sediment and litter: treatment,
 block, position on slope (the row, from 1 (top of slope) to 10 (bottom),
 in which the plot is located), the treatment of the plot immediately upslope
 from the plot, and indices of plant cover and volume (total and by
 functional group) from the plot-level sampling of vegetation (using
 fall 1997 data).
 In addition, we will test the significance of the following variables
 in explaining the accumulation of sediment and litter in individual pans
 within a plot: all variables listed above for the plot, plus indices of
 the vegetative cover and volume located immediately upslope of the pan
 (weighted for distance from the pan itself).

 Response variables:
 Vegetative cover measurements are made immediately upslope of
 erosion pans to estimate plant cover and volume. This is done at
 two scales. The three large quadrats (2 m x 2 m) are used to look
 at all large plants (height  more than 25 cm) rooted within them. The six
 small plots (50 cm x 50 cm) are used to look at all small plants
 (greater or equal to 3 cm maximum diameter, but less than or equal
 to 10 cm) rooted within them. Maximum diameter, maximum perpendicular
 diameter, and height are measured to the nearest centimeter.</para>

      <literalLayout> The Plant Diversity Experiment: The experimental area is a
 250 m x 250 m area located on the NMSU Chihuahuan Desert
 Rangeland Research Center, immediately northeast of the
 intersection of the Summerford powerline road and the road
 running along the southern boundary of the Jornada Experimental
 Range and the CDRRC. The area was gridded into 25 m x 25 m
 plots; because of some existing environmental gradients (the
 area slopes to the east, and mesquite abundance varies from
 north to south) blocks were established and treatments were
 randomly assigned to plots within blocks. A 15 m x 15 m study
 plot with a 5 m buffer area around it was established within
 each 25 m x 25 m plot.
 Each of the 48 plots of the plant diversity experiment contains
 5 pans or trays on the downslope side used to collect material
 moved by wind or water. The vegetation measurements are taken
 within 4 large quadrats (2 m x 2 m) and 6 small quadrats
 (50 cm x 50 cm) immediately upslope from each erosion pan collector.
 (Furthest distance for both large and small quadrats is 6 m
 from edge of pan).
 Erosion pans are located on downslope side of each plot, just
 outside the boundary of the central 15 m x 15 m zone within each
 plot. Pans are located at roughly equal intervals along the
 bottom line of the 15 m x 15 m square, with the two outermost pans
 (A and E) placed roughly a meter from the outside corner, pan C
 placed at the center of the 15 m line, and B and D midway between
 the corner pans and the center pan. Pans are identified A - E from
 left to right when standing below them facing upslope.</literalLayout>

      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout> Protocol for measuring vegetation upslope of erosion pans:
 Three large (2 m x 2 m) quadrats will be placed upslope from
 the pan, centered on a tape anchored at the edge of the pan. The
 quadrats are not permanently marked but are delineated during the
 measurements by extending a meter stick or measuring tape one
 meter on either side of the centrally anchored tape. All large
 plants (height  more than 25 cm) rooted within these quadrats will be
 measured (maximum diameter, maximum perpendicular diameter, and
 height -- each to the nearest centimeter). Plants will be
 identified by species acronym (see Jornada LTER plant species list)
 and by functional group: shrub, perennial grass, succulent, or
 subshrub. Annuals and perennial forbs will not be measured.
 Six smaller quadrats (50 cm x 50 cm) will be placed, two in
 each of the large quadrats, centered on the tape and the downslope
 side of the quadrat placed at the 0 cm and the 150 cm marks within
 each 2 m interval. They are numbered 1 through 6 sequentially from
 the downslope end of the tape (at the top of the erosion pan). All
 small plants (greater or equal to 3 cm maximum diameter, but less
 than or equal to 10 cm in height) will be measured as recorded as
 above. If an entry is recorded by the observer that is less than 3 cm,
 this entry should be deleted from the data set.
 Plants must be rooted in the quadrat to be measured. A plant
 being measured which is in the understory of a plant rooted outside
 of any quadrat is not considered to be an understory plant.
 A plant being measured which is in the understory of a plant rooted
 in the current quadrat or the adjacent quadrat is considered to be
 an understory plant and percent undercover of that plant is measured.
 The understory portion is estimated to the nearest 5 percent.
 Two plants of the same species whose canopies touch will be
 considered a single individual and measured as such.
 The basal stem must be at least 50% within the quadrat for the
 individual to be measured.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m).
