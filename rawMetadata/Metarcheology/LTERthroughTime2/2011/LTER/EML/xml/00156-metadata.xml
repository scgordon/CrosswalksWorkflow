    <section>
      <para>In 2003, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a prescribed burn  over a large part of the northeastern corner of the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Following this burn, a  study was designed to look at the effect of fire on above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) (i.e., the change in plant biomass,   represented by  stems, flowers, fruit and foliage, over time) within three different  vegetation types: mixed grass (MG),   mixed shrub (MS) and black grama (G). Forty permanent 1m x 1m plots were  installed in both  burned and unburned (i.e., control) sections of each habitat type.  The core black grama site  included in SEV129 is used as a G control site for analyses and does not appear in this dataset. The MG control site caught fire  unexpectedly in the  fall of  2009 and some plots were subsequently moved to the  south. For details of  how the fire affected plot placement, see Methods below. In spring 2010, sampling of plots 16-25 was discontinued at the MG (burned and control) and G (burned treatment only) sites, reducing the number of sampled plots to 30 at each.To measure ANPP (i.e., the change in plant biomass,   represented by  stems, flowers, fruit and foliage, over time), the   vegetation  variables in this dataset, including species  composition and   the  cover and height of individuals, are sampled twice  yearly (spring   and  fall) at each plot. The data from these plots is used to  build regressions correlating  biomass and volume via weights of select harvested species obtained in  SEV157, "Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data." This biomass data  is included in SEV185, "Burn Study Sites Seasonal Biomass and Seasonal and Annual NPP Data."</para>

    <geographicCoverage>
      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points Black Grama is on the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitat. The site is subject to intensive research activity, including assessments of net primary productivity, phenology, and pollinator diversity, amongst other projects.&#160; It is the site of the unburned black grama (GU) component of the Burn NPP study.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the Five Points Black Grama site.&#160; Portions of this site were burned, but not the entirety.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the burn.
&#160;Vegetation: The Five Points Black Grama site is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda)., </geographicDescription>

          <para>
            <literalLayout>Collecting the Data: Net primary production data is collected three times each year, winter, spring, and fall, for all burn sites. Spring measurements are taken in April or May when shrubs and spring annuals have reached peak biomass. Fall measurements are taken in either September or October when summer annuals have reached peak biomass but prior to killing frosts. Winter measurements are taken in February before the onset of spring growth and only creosote is measured. Vegetation data is collected on a palm top computer. A 1-m2 PVC-frame is placed over the fiberglass stakes that mark the diagonal corners of each quadrat. When measuring cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat to prevent errors caused by angle of view (parallax). Each PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string. The dimensions of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 percent of the total area. The cover (area) and height of each individual live (green) vegetative unit that falls within the one square meter quadrat is measured. A vegetative unit consists of an individual size class (as defined by a unique cover and height) of a particular species within a quadrat. Cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares filled by each vegetative unit. It is possible to obtain a total percent cover greater than 100% for a given quadrat because vegetative units for different species often overlap. Niners and plexidecs are additional tools that can help accurately determine the cover a vegetative unit. A niner is a small, hand-held PVC frame that can be used to measure canopies. Like the larger PVC frame it is divided into 10cm x 10cm squares, each square representing 1% of the total cover.  However, there are only nine squares within the frame, hence the name &#8220;niner.&#8221; A plexidec can help determine the cover of vegetative units with covers less than 1%. Plexidecs are clear plastic squares that are held above vegetation.  Each plexidec represents a cover of 0.5% and has smaller dimensions etched onto the surface that correspond to 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.25% cover. It is extremely important that cover and height measurements remain consistent over time to ensure that regressions based on this data remain valid. Field crew members should calibrate with each other to ensure that observer bias does not influence data collection Cover Measurements: Grasses-To determine the cover of a grass clump, envision a perimeter around the central mass or densest portion of the plant, excluding individual long leaves, wispy ends, or more open upper regions of the plant. Live foliage is frequently mixed with dead foliage in grass clumps and this must be kept in mind during measurement as our goal is to measure only plant biomass for the current season. In general, recently dead foliage is yellow and dead foliage is gray. Within reason, try to include only yellow or green portions of the plant in cover measurement while excluding portions of the plant that are gray. This is particularly important for measurements made in the winter when there is little or no green foliage present. In winter, sometimes measurements will be based mainly on yellow foliage. Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a separate observation from the parent plant. Forbs, shrubs and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-The cover  of forbs, shrubs and sub-shrubs is measured as the horizontal area of  the plant. If the species is an annual it is acceptable to include the  inflorescence in this measurement if it increases cover. If the species  is a perennial, do not include the inflorescence as part of the cover  measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current  season, including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid measuring  gray foliage that died in a previous season. Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha, Opuntia imbricata) measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest centimeter instead of cover and height. Cacti that occur as a dense ball/clump of stems (Opuntia leptocaulis) are measured using the same protocol as shrubs. Pincushion or hedgehog cacti (Escobaria vivipara, Schlerocactus intertextus, Echinocereus fendleri) that occur as single (or clustered) cylindrical stems are measured as a single cover. Yuccas-Make separate observations for the leaves and caudex (thick basal stem). Break the observations into sections of leaves that are approximately the same height and record the cover as the perimeter around this group of leaf blades. The caudex is measured as a single cover. The thick leaves of yuccas make it difficult to make a cover measurement by centering yourself over the caudex of the plant. The cover of the caudex may be estimated by holding a niner next to it or using a tape measure to measure to approximate the area. Height Measurements: Height is recorded as a whole number in centimeters. All heights are vertical heights but they are not necessarily perpendicular to the ground if the ground is sloping. Annual grasses and all forbs-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the inflorescence (if present). Otherwise, measure to the top of the green foliage. Perennial grasses-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the live green foliage. Do not include the inflorescence in the height measurement. The presence of live green foliage may be difficult to see in the winter. Check carefully at the base of the plant for the presence of green foliage. If none is found it may be necessary to pull the leaf sheaths off of several plants outside the quadrat. From this you may be able to make some observations about where green foliage is likely to occur. Perennial shrub and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-Measure the height from the base of the green foliage to the top of the green foliage, ignoring all bare stems. Do not measure to the ground unless the foliage reaches the ground.Plants rooted outside but hanging into a quadrat-Do not measure the height from the ground. Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat.Creosote Measurements till 2013: To measure creosote (i.e., Larrea tridenta) break the observations into two categories: 1.) Small, individual clusters of foliage on a branch (i.e., branch  systems): Measure the horizontal cover of each live (i.e., green)   foliage cluster, ignoring small open spaces (keeping in mind the 15%   guideline stated above). Then measure the vertical "height" of each   cluster from the top of the foliage to a plane created by extending a   line horizontally from the bottom of the foliage. Each individual   foliage cluster within a bush is considered a separate observation. 2.) Stems: Measure the length of each stem from the base to the   beginning of live (i.e., green) foliage.  Calculate the cumulative total   of all stem measurements.  This value is entered under "height" with   the species as "stem" for each quadrat containing creosote.  All other   variable receive a default entry of "1" for creosote stem measurements. Do not measure dead stems or areas of dead foliage.  If in doubt   about whether a stem is alive, scrape the stem with your fingernail and   check for the presence of green cambium.Creosote Measurements 2013 and after:Each creosote is only measured as one total cover. Each quad that contains creosote will have one cover observation for each creosote canopy in quad. Recording the Data: Excel spreadsheets are used for data entry and file names should begin with the overall study (npp), followed by the date (mm.dd.yy) and the initials of the recorder (.abc). Finally, the site abbreviation should be added (i.e., mg, ms, or g). The final format should be as follows: npp_burn.mm.dd.yy.abc.xls.  File names should be in lowercase.August 2009 Burn: On August 4, 2009, a    lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta    National Wildlife    Refuge.&#160; The fire reached the Mixed-Grass Unburned plots on August 5,    2009, consuming them in their entirety.&#160; As a result, in the spring of    2010, the Mixed-Grass (MG) unburned plots were moved to a different  area   within Deep Well, southwest of the Warming site.&#160; Also, on  August  4, 2009, some of the webs and quadrats within the unburned  Black Grama (G) site were  impacted by the fire.&#160; Thus, webs 2 and 3  were abandoned and extra plots  added to areas within webs 1, 4, and 5  that were not burned.&#160; Changes  were as follows: Webs 1, 4, and 5: A plot was added to the northeast to compensate for the loss of all plots at webs 2 and 3. Web 4: A plot was added to the northwest to compensate for the northern plot, which was burned.</literalLayout>
