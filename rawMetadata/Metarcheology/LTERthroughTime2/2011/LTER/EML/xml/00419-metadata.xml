  <abstract>
    <section>
      <para>Dryland environments are estimated to cover around 40% of the global land surface, and are home to approximately 2.4 billion people. Many of these areas have recently experienced extensive land degradation. This study focuses on semi-arid areas in the US Southwest, where degradation over the past 150 years has been characterized by the invasion of woody vegetation into areas previously dominated by grasslands. This vegetation change has been associated with increases in soil erosion and water quality problems, including the loss of key nutrients such as carbon from the soil to adjacent fluvial systems. Such loss of resources may impact heavily upon the amount of carbon that is lost as the land becomes more heavily degraded.Therefore, understanding these vegetation transitions is significant both for sustainable land use and global biogeochemical cycling. This study uses an ecohydrological approach to develop an understanding of the relationship between structure and function across these transitions. This is done via the monitoring of rainfall-runoff events across instrumented runoff plots with different vegetation characteristics to investigate fluvial sediment fluxes during intense summer monsoon season rainfall events.</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points Black Grama is on the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitat. The site is subject to intensive research activity, including assessments of net primary productivity, phenology, and pollinator diversity, amongst other projects.&#160; It is the site of the unburned black grama (GU) component of the Burn NPP study.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the Five Points Black Grama site.&#160; Portions of this site were burned, but not the entirety.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the burn.
&#160;Vegetation: The Five Points Black Grama site is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda)., </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Five Points area emcompasses both the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote study sites.&#160; Five Points falls along the transition between the Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats.&#160; Both core sites are subject to intensive research activities, including NPP measurements, phenology observations, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments.&#160; There are rain-out shelters for drought studies in both the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote sites.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosote overstory, with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (Opuntia macrocentra), and soapweed yucca as co-occurring shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous, dense, grass-dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama Site.  Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bushmuhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii).  Notable forbs include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea spp.)., siteid: 3</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Cerro Montosa Pinyon-Juniper site has been the location of major Sevilleta LTER research since 1989. Meteorological trends, net primary productivity, rodent and ground-dwelling arthropod populations, mycorrhizal responses to fertilizer, pinyon-juniper fruit and nut production, and pinyon mortality are all being investigated at this site. Previous studies have included analyses of pinyon tree rings for regional climate reconstruction.Vegetation: The vegetation is New Mexico Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, dominated by Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), and accompanied by gray oak (Quercus grisea).  There is a diverse shrub component, including scrub live oak (Q. turbinella), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), sacahuista (Nolina microcarpa), red barberry (Mahonia haematocarpa), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), skunkbush (Rhus trilobata), and banana yucca (Yucca baccata).  Grass diversity is also high, and open spaces between trees are dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), with hairy and sideoats grama (B. hirsuta and B. curtipendula) and black grama (B. eriopoda) also being significant. Other common grasses include purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), wolftail (Lycurus phleoides), mountain and ring muhly (M. montanus and M. torreyi), and New Mexican porcupinegrass (Heterostipa neomexicana). Common forbs include small-flowered milkvetch (Astragalus nuttallianus), white sagebrush (Artemesia ludoviciana), Fendler&#8217;s arabis (Arabis fendleri), Fendler&#8217;s sandmat (Chamaesyce fendleri), New Mexico thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum), false pennyroyal (Hedeoma oblongifolia), bastard sage (Eriogonum wrightii), ping&#252;e rubberweed (Hymenoxys richardsonii), large four o&#8217;clock (Mirabilis multiflora), Fendler's penstemon (Penstemon fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea hastulata and S. wrightii). , </geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Experimental design:&#160;Each study area consisted of a 10m wide, 30m long, downslope runoff plot, bound at the top and sides with aluminum flashing and fitted with water collecting guttering at the bottom so inputs and outputs could be quantified. The guttering fed water into a flume fixed into the ground at 4&#8304; allowing water leaving the plot as runoff to be quantified.The flumes were instrumented with a pump sampler to collect runoff samples leaving the plot and a bubbler module to measure discharge. In addition all runoff and associated sediment was collected in a covered stock tank (560 gallons for study area 1and2, 1000 gallons for study are 3). Rainfall onto the plot was measured using tipping-bucket rain gauges connected to the pump sampler. Following rainfall events all data was downloaded from the sampler using Flowlink v3.2 software.Eroded sediment was collected from stock tank following rainfall events, coarse organic matter was removed via flotation, samples were oven dried at 60&#8304;C, weighed and sieved for particle size analysis using US. standard sieves at the Sevilleta LTER field station.Setting up plots:&#160;Plots were selected on comparable planar slopes in areas believed to be representative of endmember vegetation habitats. &#160;</literalLayout>
