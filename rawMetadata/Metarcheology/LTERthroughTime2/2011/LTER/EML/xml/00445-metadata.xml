      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout> JORNADA LTER II: Protocol for Lizard Pitfalls

 OVERVIEW.
 A grid of 16 pitfall traps is located at each consumer
 plot. Each trap is 40 cm deep and contains an inner plastic
 container and funnel. A ceramic tile is placed over each
 trap. For a 2-week period each sample period, the tiles are
 raised on one side, and the traps are checked every 3 days in
 summer and once a week in winter. Individual lizards are
 taken from the traps, identified, sexed, measured, and
 weighed. Each lizard was clipped with a unique number
 using the codes on the diagram on the field data sheets. Toe
 clipping was done from 1989 to 1995. Starting in March 1995
 toe clipping was terminated and lizards were instead marked
 with a black sharpie marking pen to provide a temporary mark to
 determine recapture status over a particular 2-week trapping
 period. A black mark is made posterior to the cloaca on the
 ventral base of the tail. Trapping grid is a 4x4 with 15 meter
 interval between traps.

 I. INTRODUCTION. In conjunction with net primary production
 studies, consumer and faunal studies are conducted at or
 near NPP sites using pitfall traps. We use live traps,
 not employing ethylene glycol or other
 killing/preservative agents, with traps checked once a
 week at the minimum. Sampling-with-replacement is used
 with the lizards but without replacement for the
 arthropods; thus any released arthropods, when possible,
 should not be let go in the immediate vicinity of the
 pitfall grids (Note: separate pitfall traps for
 arthropods were established in 1995 for LTER-III).

 Lizard pitfall studies are conducted quarterly over
 a period of two weeks: in February-March (following
 winter NPP), in May-June (following spring NPP), in
 August, and in October-November (following fall NPP).

 A. LOCATION: Pitfall grids consist of sixteen
 stations (four rows of four traps) located at the
 following ll sites (the old code, no longer used, is
 given in parentheses following each site*): T-WEST
 (TBA), T-EAST (TBB), M-RABB-A (MDA), M-NORT (formerly
 M-RABB-C (MDC), moved to M-NORT in 1995), M-WELL
 (MDB), G-IBPE-C (GLC), G-SUMM (formerly G-IBPE-A
 (GLA), moved to G-SUMM in 1995) G-BASN (GLB), C-SAND-B
 (CBB), C-CALI (CBA), and C-GRAV (CBD). Pitfalls
 formerly located at MB (mixed basin slope NE of
 weather trailer) and C-SAND-C (CBC) have been closed.
 No pitfalls are directly associated with the following
 NPP sites: P-COLL, P-SMAL, P-TOBO (because of flooding
 potential), T-TAYL, or G-SUMM. The pitfall for C-SAND
 is located NW of the NPP site (see site map). The
 location of each trap is marked by a rebar bearing a
 numbered aluminum tag.
 * (old codes may still be found in data books and vial
 labels)

 B. CONSTRUCTION: The LTER pitfall traps are walled by two
 large vegetable cans, 6" diameter; size 10 tomato cans
 (6 lbs, 3 oz, ca. 6 l/2" high) are most common. The
 ends of the cans are cut out and the cans stacked so
 that the top of the upper can is nearly flush with the
 ground. Similar-sized coffee cans may be used; the
 funnel (see below) should fit the can with little
 excess space. The collection container is a slightly
 tapered plastic beverage cup 5 l/2" deep with top
 diameter of 4 l/2"; several small (ca. l/16") holes
 are drilled in the bottom of each cup to facilitate
 drainage. A polypropylene funnel with top diameter of
 5 l/2" is placed in the cup to seal the trap and
 prevent escapes; the stem and lower funnel are cut
 off about 4" below the top, making a lower hole of ca.
 l l/2- 1 3/4" diameter. The cups are supported on
 small stones or wooden blocks to raise the top of the
 funnel nearer the top of the can (it should not be
 flush); elevation of cups is especially important in
 poorly drained sites. When not in use, the traps are
 sealed by a ceramic tile with dirt packed along sides
 (see procedure below). Trap numbers (l-16) originally
 were stamped on a small aluminum block fastened to a
 rebar next to each pit. Many of these blocks are now
 missing. More recently, sites have been numbered with
 aluminum tags attached to the rebar. If both the
 block and tag are missing, the number can be
 determined by counting from the northeast corner of
 the grid (l-4 north-south, 5-8 next line south-north,
 etc.). However, some sites, notably BASN, have a
 different numbering scheme so always check adjacent
 trap numbers if unsure.

 A SITE MAP IS INCLUDED WITH THIS PROTOCOL

 II. PROCEDURE: Traps are usually opened on a Friday; the
 tiles are excavated and propped open l to 2" at one end
 using wooden blocks or stones. Be sure the tile covers
 the trap as completely as possible. During spring and
 summer, collections are made the Tuesday and Friday the
 week after opening and again Tuesday and Friday (close)
 of the next week. In fall and winter, collections on
 Fridays are sufficient. Take care to look under the cup;
 both lizards and arthropods (especially scorpions and
 crickets) will readily hide there. Any lizards found
 are carefully grasped (don't grab tail!) and subjected
 to the measurements detailed in section A below. Be sure
 to use forceps on venemous arthropods. Note special
 procedures for juvenile lizards. Before leaving for the
 field, make certain that you have the bag with measuring
 equipment (below) and a box with labelled cups (w/lids)
 for the eleven pitfall sites plus an additional
 unlabelled cup for each participant. The data book
 should be on a clipboard which has a list of lizard
 species codes and identification information affixed.
 IMPORTANT: the clipboard should also had an updated list
 of the identification numbers previously used in toe
 marking for the period prior to 1995.
 Equipment for processing lizards includes a metric
 ruler, scales, forceps, plastic bags, black sharpie
 markers, pencils, and a reptile field guide. The scale
 is a PESOLA (l00 gram) spring-type; it is expensive so
 should be kept out of the dirt. Equipment kept in a
 zippered bag either in FH 117 or 236. The following
 information is recorded in the Jornada LTER II Lizard
 Pitfall data book for each lizard:

 l. Pit number (see above).

 2. Species code: Lizard species are recorded using a four
 letter code (first two letters of generic and
 species names). Cnemidiphorus tigris is thus CNTI, etc.

 3. Sex: record an M, F, or J (juvenile) for each lizard.
 The field guide and clipboard information may assist in
 sexing, which differs in different families.

 4. Rec.: If individuals have been previously marked with
 a black
 5. sharpie marker, record an R (recapture). Record an N
 for unmarked adults.

 6. Markings. Prior to 1995: Toe mark: For newly captured
 adults, toes are clipped according to the numbering
 system shown on each page of the data book. Note that
 the ventral side of the lizard is shown in the
 diagram. With scissors, clip the first 2 mm or so of
 the required toes. As lizards have only five
 toes, numbers 6-9 are not used in the codes. Upon
 reaching number "6" one should skip to the next
 availble combination (e.g. HOMA "2046" would skip to
 2050; UTST "56" would skip to 100. Close attention
 should be given to avoid toe clipping errors. It is
 also imperative that accurate and updated records be
 kept (on provided clipboard sheet) of numbers used; be
 sure this sheet is brought to the field each time.
 Severe problems have occurred in the past with skipped
 and duplicated numbers. In general, JUVENILES,
 especially small ones, should not be toe clipped as
 the required handling may injure them. Put a dash
 across the "toe mark" space for small juveniles.
 After 1995: Each new lizard is marked with a back
 sharpie marker at the ventral base of the tail
 posterior to the cloaeca.

 7. S-V: record length (in mm) from snout apex to vent for
 each lizard. Exercise great care in handling juveniles
 for any measurements. Estimates might be better for very
 small juveniles; the handling needed to position the
 lizard for measurement may be injurious. If the juvenile
 is not too active it can be measured in the cup.

 8. Total length: record total length in mm from snout to tail
 tip for each lizard.

 9. Weight: place lizard in plastic bag and clip bag to the
 scale. Keeping bag out of wind if possible, note weight
 in grams (subtract bag weight) and record in data book.
 Very small to small juveniles can be estimated at l gram.

 10. Tail: record as whole (W) or broken (B). If tail is
 broken and regrown, record as broken and make a note at
 the bottom of the page.

 A SAMPLE LIZARD DATA BOOK PAGE IS INCLUDED WITH THIS PROTOCOL

 III. CLOSING PITFALLS: on the last day of collections, close
 the pitfalls by lowering the tiles to the ground
 surface and covering the pitfall as well as possible, and
 then packing soil or sand tightly around the edges and
 top of the tile. Soil on top may discourage coyotes and
 help assure tight closure. A shovel or trowel is useful
 in closing the traps. Be sure to place a stone atop the
 tile or it may be difficult to find the trap again.
 Sloppily closed pitfalls will be deathtraps for any
 organisms getting in, so take time to seal them.

 IV. GENERAL PROBLEMS
 l. Poor drainage (or flooding) is a problem in
 several areas, especially tarbush and BASN.
 If traps and cups are flooded, pour the cup
 onto a flat surface and try to recover as many
 organisms as possible (note in book any not
 kept). Using the cup, bail as much water out of
 the trap as possible.
 2. Broken tiles: this has been a problem at the
 RABB sites which are open to grazing. Tiles
 from the LTER I transect have been used as
 replacements. An extra tile is usually kept with
 the pitfall box and a box of tiles has
 been kept in the annex.
 3. Broken funnels: plastic funnels eventually
 begin to crack and must be replaced. If broken
 funnels are noticed make a note for immediate
 replacement. Some funnels are available in the
 FH236 lab.
 4. Natural toe loss in lizards may have affected the toe
 marking system. If new captures had lost toes
 (usually only one foot will be affected), attempts were
 made to incorporate the digit into the marking scheme.
 Toe losses in marked recaptures may be told by
 reference to the marking lists and should be
 noted in the data book.
 5. Escapees: large, active lizards are easily
 capable of escaping from one's grip and
 occasionally from untended traps with the tile
 off. Beware of lizards running up your arm as
 you attempt to pull them from traps- a quick grab
 is safer than "slow fishing." If a lizard
 escapes, note as much information as you can
 about it and then write "escaped" across the rest
 of the row.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha 
                         Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State 
                         University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is 
                         administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER 
                         Network, one of  more than 25 long term sites funded by the U.S. National Science 
                         Foundation.</literalLayout>
