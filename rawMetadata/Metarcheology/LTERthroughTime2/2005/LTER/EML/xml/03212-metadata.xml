The late age at which females reproduce initially is especially remarkable. In order to complete a life table for the species at Coweeta, we need to 1)collect approximately 30 adult females, 2)dissect their reproductive organs to determine reproductive status and count follicles, and 3) age them using skeletochronology to determine annual growth marks in femurs. Toward this end we are asking permission to collect the specimens in May and early June of 2001 from a number of streams in Coweeta. Ideally, we would like to distribute the sampling over at least 10 streams or watersheds, to minimize the impacts on the population of any given stream.</para><para>In the field we simply turn rocks in and along streams and capture the salamanders by hand. On return to the laboratory the salamanders are preserved (using approved methods in accordance with IACUC guidelines), the reproductive organs are dissected, and the femurs are removed, sectioned, stained, and 

examined microscopically for annual growth marks.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>salamanders</keyword><keyword>life table</keyword><keyword>survivorship</keyword><keyword>fecundity</keyword><keyword>life history</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary2013_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>I propose to distribute sampling over a number of streams/watersheds (perhaps 10-15) in order to minimize impacts on any single watershed.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
