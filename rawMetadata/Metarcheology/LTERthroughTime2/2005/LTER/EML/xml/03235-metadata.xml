The research goal  is to examine the phenologic and reproductive responses of a set of  species to experimentally-induced warming at a network of sites.  The ITEX design is hierarchical, with sites participating at whatever  level they are able. At the minimum, participation in ITEX requires  climate monitoring (using the LTER MSR standards), a temperature  manipulation using one of three possible designs, and monitoring  phenologic and reproductive variables for at least one designated  ITEX species or two other species. The temperature manipulation is achieved through use of conical or hexagonal open-top chambers  of solar fiberglass, which have been shown to increase the air  temperature at the surface approximately 3 degrees C. ITEX studies  at Niwot Ridge, a logical outgrowth of the long-term phenology  studies there, uses a factorial design based around the long-term  snowfence experiment. Twenty cones are placed behind the snowfence,  distributed at 10, 25, 45, and 75 m from the fence; each cone is  paired with an adjacent plot. Beginning with the 1995 season, 24 additional plots were implemented outside of the snowfence influence. Twelve cones are distributed beyond both the north and south edges of the snowfence area, at 10, 25, 45, and 75 m behind the line  of the snowfence; each cone is paired with an adjacent plot. This  results in the following treatments: increased winter snow, increased  summer temperature, increased snow and increased temperature,  and control. Key phenologic, growth, and reproductive traits are being  followed on marked individuals of Acomastylis rossii and Bistorta  bistortoides, and complete species composition is being monitored.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>ITEX</keyword><keyword>plant development</keyword><keyword>plant growth</keyword><keyword>warming effects</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?itexquan.mw</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1993-07-08</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1996-08-15</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription /><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The initial iteration of the documentation section was created by Rick Ingersoll on 18 October 1993, with some sources being a 6 July 1993  email message from Marilyn Walker and a 15 September 1993 email  message from Mike Sannes. Data for 8 July through 13 August 1993  were appended to the data section on 18 October 1993 and the file was put under sccs control at this time as well.[RCI 18 October 1993] Comments regarding the plot code were added on 22 October 1993. [RCI 22 October 1993] Comments regarding plot locations were  provided by Susan Kindig on 5 November 1993 and incorporated into the comments section on 8 November 1993.[RCI 8 November 1993] A minor modification was made to the abstract per instructions of Marilyn Walker on 11 March 1994.[RCI 11 March 1994] Data for 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13 June 1994 were appended to the data section on 15 June 1994 and additional information was added to the comments section at that time as well.[RCI 15 June 1994] Data for 15 and 16 June 1994 were appended to the data section on 24 June 1994.[RCI 24 June 1994] Data for 20-21 &amp; 23-24 June 1994 were appended to the data section on 30 June 1994.[RCI 30 June 1994] Data entry errors (width of  longest leaf for plant AR-4 in 45-4C on 7 June 1994 and height from ground to highest point &amp; length of longest leaf for plant AR-1 in  45-3E on 15 June 1994) due to ambiguous entries on the hard-copy  forms were corrected on 5 July 1994.[RCI 5 July 1994] Data for  27 &amp; 28 June and 5 July 1994 were appended to the data section on 13 July 1994.[RCI 13 July 1994] Data for 27 &amp; 28 June and 5 July 1994 were deleted from the data section on 26 August 1994,  because the data for at least 27 June 1994 was incomplete as originally appended. The complete data for these dates was  reappended on 26 August 1994, as were the data for 8, 11, 22, &amp; 25 July 1994, and 1, 4, &amp; 8 August 1994. The comments and  header sections were updated to reflect changes in the format of the columns containing the total fruit and mean fruit weights. [RCI 26 August 1994] Comments from the hard-copy field data forms  were added to the comments section on 3 October 1994.[RCI 3 October  1994] Data for 20, 21, 22, and 27 June 1995 were appended to the data section on 3 July 1995.[RCI 3 July 1995] Data for 10 July 1995 were appended to the data section on 14 July 1995.[RCI 14 July 1995] Data for 3, 7, and 16 July 1995 were inserted or appended to the data section on 19 July 1995.[RCI 19 July 1995] Data for 24 and 31 July 1995 and 7, 16, and 24 August 1995 were appended to the data section on 20 October 1995.[MAH 20 October 1995] Data for 3 and 18 September 1995 were appended to the data section on 27 October 1995.[MAH 27 October 1995] Data for all of 1995 for plants 103C,BB3 and 105E,BB4 were changed to missing values on 19 December 1995, after it was  determined by L. Turner that these plants were incorrectly  identified as Bistorta bistortoides. Comments were added to the abstract and comments section regarding the introduction of the plots external to the snowfence.[MAH 19 December 1995] Data for the external plots for 1995 were inserted into the data section on 20 December 1995. Comments from the hard copy data forms were also added to the comments section on 20 December 1995.[MAH 20 December 1995] On 2 August 1996, it was determined that the 1995 external plot data did not contain a column for the mean dry weight per fruit (COL10). No fruit weights were collected for the external plots in 1995, so an empty column was appended to the end of each record in order to maintain a consistent format on 2 August 1996.[MAH 2 August 1996] Data for 1996 were appended to the data section and comments from the  1996 hard-copy field data forms were inserted into the comments section on 12 November 1996.[MAH 12 November 1996] URL locations  for related data were updated on 26 September 2000.[MAH 26 September  2000]</para></description></maintenance><contact scope="document"><organizationName>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of
