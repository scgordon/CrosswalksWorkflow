Poles were driven into the snowpack to form transects in several  snow-accumulation areas (east face of Arikaree Peak, talus on the north side of Kiowa Peak, rock glacier/wetland between Green Lakes 4 and 5, Arikaree  Glacier, Green Lakes 4 and 5, and the Martinelli basin). The height difference  (cm) between the snow surface and the top of each pole was recorded. On the  subsequent visit the new height difference was recorded and the pole was  driven into the snow and the reset height was recorded. Poles in a given  transect were relocated as necessary during the course of the season.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>ablation rate</keyword><keyword>mean ablation</keyword><keyword>meltout</keyword><keyword>snow</keyword><keyword>snowdepth</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?ablamean.nc</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1969-07-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-10-06</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription /><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The documentation section of this file was created by Susan Kindig and Rick Ingersoll in late August of 1993.[RCI 30 August 1993] Data for  25 May through 26 August 1993 were added to the data section and this file was put under sccs control on 31 August 1993.[RCI 31 August 1993] Data for 1989 through 1992 were inserted into the data section on  1 September 1993.[RCI 1 September 1993] Data for 2 and 9 September  were added to the data section on 30 September 1993.[RCI 30 September 1993] Data for 23 and 30 September and 7 October 1993 were appended to the data section on 14 October 1993.[14 October 1993] The GL5R code was changed to ROCK in the data section to be consistent with other data from the same site that are to be added to this file at a later date.[RCI 5 May 1994] The data section was converted from whitespace- to comma-delimited on 17 May 1994.[RCI 17 May 1994] Data for the  years 1969-70 and 1981-86 were inserted into the data section, site code list was updated, and appropriate comments regarding processing were added on 31 May 1994.[RCI 31 May 1994] A comment was added, on 6  July 1994 regarding some of the missing data.[RCI 6 July 1994] The 9999 and 99.99 missing value indicators for time and mean ablation, respectively, were converted to absence of values for consistency with other files in this directory and to conserve space on 13 July 1994.
