changes in oxygen within closed chambers during separate light and dark  
incubations (Bott et al., 1978; Pennak &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; LaVelle, 1979; King, 1982; Duff et al.,  
1984).  Rocks with epilithon were placed in sealed Plexiglas chambers filled with  
river water.  Dissolved oxygen decreased in the dark due to respiration alone and  
normally increased in the light due to the net effect of photosynthesis and  
respiration.  Photosynthesis was estimated as the sum of dissolved oxygen changes  
in the light and dark incubations. 
        The chambers were constructed from a 25 cm length of stock cast acrylic  
tubing (21.590 cm O.D by 0.635 cm wall).  A piston, constructed from a 5 cm  
length of stock cast acrylic tubing (20.320 cm O.D. by 0.635 cm wall), was used  
to isolate the interior of the chamber from the atmosphere.  The piston fit  
snugly, but not tightly, into the chamber.  Oxygen leaks into the chamber were  
limited to the minute area between the piston and chamber and the long diffusion  
path, through water, along the piston edge.  A BOD port on the top of the piston  
accepted a stirred, BOD probe from an Orbisphere Model 2714  oxygen meter.  Water  
was recirculated in the chamber with an external, submersible pump.  Water  
samples were removed for analysis by displacing the piston with the sample tube  
open.  When not in use, the sample tube was pinched closed and the BOD port was  
stoppered with a #1 rubber stopper.   
        Rocks were collected at random locations within pools or riffles at each  
site.  Surface rocks with a "typical" development of epilithon, based on visual  
inspection of the site, were selected for study.  We rejected rocks with heavy  
moss growth and favored rocks of a uniform size and shape, that would fit neatly  
in the chamber bottom.  We found that 3 to 4 rocks of a modal shape and size  
would essentially cover the chamber bottom in a single layer, at a surface  
density similar to that found in the river.   
        Water for the incubations was collected in carboys.  Rocks were collected  
from the river and placed in coolers, without water, to keep them cool and moist.  
 We found that if the rocks were kept submerged in water in the coolers, delicate  
epilithic material was dislodged during transport from the field to the lab.   
Without water, we were able to transport the rocks and epilithon, and place them  
in the chambers with the epilithon essentially intact, even with flocculent pool  
epilithon.  The time from collection and transport to installation in a chamber  
was generally 1-2 h. 
        At the lab, rocks were carefully lowered into an open chamber previously  
filled with fresh river water.  The piston was inserted into the chamber and all  
bubbles were removed via the open BOD port.  The piston was pushed into the  
chamber as far as  practical, to minimize the headspace volume and so maximize  
the change in dissolved oxygen concentration per unit time.  The entire chamber  
and pump were submerged in a recirculating water bath to maintain constant water  
temperatures near those found in the Kuparuk River.  Toolik Lake was used as a  
source of cooling water.  Each chamber could be illuminated by four, fluorescent,  
plant and aquarium bulbs that together provided about 190 uE m-2 sec-1 of energy  
at the chamber surface.  The lights, water bath, and chambers were operated under  
a thick, rubberized tarp to enable dark incubations. 
        In a typical experiment, four chambers were run simultaneously.  After rocks  
were in place and chambers were sealed and submerged, we started with dark  
incubations.  Dissolved oxygen and chamber temperature were measured at three  
time points, until thedissolved oxygen had been reduced by 3 to 4 mg O2/L orapproximately 4 h had elapsed.  After the third time point, we turned on the  
lights and measured dissolved oxygen at two additional time points, until the  
dissolved oxygen returned to the initial reading or approximately 4 h had elapsed  
in the light (8 h from the beginning of the experiment).  Typically dissolved  
oxygen decreased linearly in the dark and increased linearly in the light.  If  
non-linearity was encountered (e.g. supersaturation in the light), only the first  
two data points in a sequence were used in the calculations.  Water samples were  
taken at the beginning and end of each experiment to monitor N dynamics in the  
chambers. 
        At the end of each experiment, rocks were removed from each chamber and the  
epilithic material was scrubbed from the rocks with a wire brush, into a known  
volume of clean water (usually 2 or 5 L), mixed vigorously, and replicate volumes  
(usually 5 or 10 ml) were removed by pipette and filtered onto 25 mm, Whatman,  
GF/F filter papers.  Each filter paper was placed in 10 ml of 90% acetone/10%  
water in a polyethylene, screw-cap, centrifuge tube and extracted in the dark for  
24 to 48 h.  Chlorophyll a in the acetone/water extract was estimated by  
fluorometry (Greenberg et al. 1985).  The amount of epilithic chlorophyll a  
originally on the rocks in each chamber was calculated from this concentration  
plus the total and sub-sampled volumes. 
        Epilithic chlorophyll a, photosynthesis, and respiration expressed on a per  
chamber basis, were converted to an areal basis by multiplying each variable by  
the area of the chamber bottom (0.0324 m2).  Essentially, this assumes that the  
cobble density in the chamber is similar to that in the river and that only the  
top layer of cobble is important for the variables measured.  More complicated  
methods could be used to ascertain rock surface area per unit area of stream bed  
(e.g. Naiman, 1983; Murphy, 1984).  However, this method was quick, unbiased, and  
is probably not in error by more than a factor of two (i.e. misrepresented the  
true rock surface area by 1/2 to 2 times) as long as the chambers were loaded  
with similar cobble sizes, shapes, and densities.   
        Ammonium was measured in headspace water by a manual, phenol-hypochlorite  
method in which ammonium was measured as an indophenol dye at 640 nm (Grasshoff &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;  
Johannsen, 1972).  Nitrite was measured as a diazo dye at 540 nm (Bendschneider &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;  
Robinson, 1952).  Nitrite was typically at or below detection limits.  Nitrate  
was converted to nitrite using a manual, mossy cadmium reduction method  
(MacKereth et al., 1978; Jones, 1984; Elliot &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Porter, 1971).

unit total chlorophyll a, i.e. the ASSIMILATION COEFFICIENT.  The variables  
INITNH4, INITNO2, and INITNO23 refer to the initial concentrations of ammonium,  
nitrite, and nitrite+nitrate in the chambers.  RATENH4, RATENO2, and RATENO23

extraction in 90% acetone WITHOUT grinding.  Extraction for at  
least 24h in dark.  Read on Turner 111 fluorometer.  Working  
equation: 
 
                                                        (meter reading x 100)

                        where, 
                        meter reading = fluorometer reading from Turner 111 
                        100 = a factor required to correct for the ammeter 
                        %filter = filter used to attenuate light to instrument range  
                window = used to attenuate light 
                 
                        This is converted to CHLa per unit stream bottom area, as follows: 
 
                                                (total mls of scrubbate) (mls acetone used)

                                          (mls filtered)(mls acetone expected)(m2 chamber 
area) 
 
                        total mls = scrubate volume, either 2000 or 5000 mls 
                mls acetone = volume used to extract, always 10 ml in 1989 
                        mls filtered = aliquot of total mls, usually 2 or 5 mls 
                mls acetone expected = should be 10 mls, thus the ratio of mls  
acetone used and that expected shoud be 1. 
                chamber area = constant = 0.0324 m2 for 1989 piston chambers 
                    
                        NOTE:  This calculation is a revision from the original method and  
supersedes any earlier descriptions.  WBB 8 May 1997. 
 
                        NOTE: Standard Methods (Section 10200H, 1989, 17th Edition)  
reports that fluorometric determination of phaeopigments when  
calculating chlorophyll a is not recommended when chlorphyll b is  
present.  Acidification of the sample produces phaeophytin b which  
fluoresces at the same wavelength as phaeophytin a.  This will  
cause the overestimation of phaeophytin a concentrations and an  
underestimations of active chlorophyll a.  Although phaeophytin a  
concentrations were estimated (PHAEO) these data are unreliable  
and should not be used in any calculations of chlorophyll.   
Corrected chlorophyll a (CCHLA), which depends on PHAEO, should  
not be used.  TOTAL chlorophyll a is the variable that has been  
used in the calculations of respiration, gross photosynthesis, and  
net photosynthesis per unit chlorophyll a.     Total chlorophyll a  
has been used in all calculations in metabolism files from 1989 -  
1992. 
 
RESP, PHOTO, and NET 
 
        These variables were calculated from the change in oxygen during incubations  
of 1 to several hours in either light or dark conditions. 
 
                        RESP = (final DO - initial DO)/(incubation time) in DARK 
 
                        NET = (final DO - initial DO)/(incubation time) in LIGHT 
 
                        PHOTO = NET + RESP = LIGHT + DARK 
 
                where DO is the dissolved oxygen content in mgO2/liter.  Note that the  
absolute values of RESP and DARK are used in the PHOTO equation. 
 
INITNH4, INITNO2, and INITNO23 
 
        Calculated from standard curves of absorbance versus known concentrations of  
standard solutions. 
 
                concentration (ugN/liter) = [(m) * (absorbance)] + b 
 
RATENH4, RATENO2, and RATENO23 
 
        Calculated from changes in nutrient content within chambers from the  
beginning to the end of the incubation. 
 
                rate = (final [N] - initial [N])/(incubation time) 
 
        where [N] is the nutrient concentration.
