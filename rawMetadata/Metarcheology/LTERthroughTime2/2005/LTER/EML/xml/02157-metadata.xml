Data are collected at each of 40 points designated as sampling points for animal studies. Measurements include temperature, dew point and absolute and relative humidity.

There are 40 groups of data files, one for each of the 40 points in the LFDP. The first four digits for each file in a group are the same and reflect the grid point identifier in the LFDP. Thus, grid point 03,03 will have data files beginning 0303. The last four digits reflect the month and year of the first data point in the file (e.g., 03030200 contains data from point 03,03 that was collected beginning in February 2000). For point 03,03 only, two sensors were deployed, one at 1.0 m and the other at 0.5 m. Names of data files for the high sensor contain the letters "hi" after the grid point identifier, and names of data files for the low sensor contain the letters "lo" after the grid point identifier. Data from the entire data set were exported to Excel books, two books for each grid point, one containing temperature data in degrees Centigrade and the other containing data for relative humidity. Names for these books reflect the grid cell identifier as well as whether the data are for temperature (0303T) or relative humidity (0303RH). Data from different collection periods are separated on different sheets in the Excel books, with pages labeled with the month and year of the first data point on the sheet.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>LFDP</keyword><keyword>abiotic</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>dew point</keyword><keyword>environment</keyword><keyword>gradient</keyword><keyword>humidity</keyword><keyword>meteorology</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>weather</keyword><keyword>Disturbance Patterns</keyword><keyword>Population Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Primary Productivity</keyword><keyword>Disturbance Regime</keyword><keyword>Environmental properties</keyword><keyword>Recovery After Disturbance</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>ADEQUATE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><para><literalLayout>The scientists, the LEF-LTER Program, and the                                     USDA International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) must                                     receive adequate acknowledgement for the use of data by other                                     scientists, and the LEF LTER program must receive two copies of                                     any publication using that data.

It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events.

Each HOBO is placed inside an inverted beverage cup (white plastic, 16 oz). The cups are suspended by string so that the sensor opening rests 50 cm above the ground. During the initial sampling period (February 6-May 15, 2000), placement of the cups was irregular. The measured distance from the ground during this period for each cup is shown in the table above. All cups were corrected on May 15, 2000, so that sensors were a measured 50 cm above the ground. However, given the uneven nature of the substrate in the LFDP, placement of the sensors could vary &#194;&#177; 10 cm from the average ground level around the sampling point. Data were downloaded from the sensors using a HOBO Shuttle &#194;&#169; ONSET Corporation and transferred to a computer using Boxcar Pro 4.0 software &#194;&#169; ONSET Computer Corporation 1999 (P.O. Box 3450, Pocasset, MA 02559-3450; phone, 508/759-9500; email, loggerhelp@onsetcomp.com). Subsequent maintenance of the data was performed using the same software. HOBO Pro Series sensors, HOBO Shuttles, and Boxcar Pro 4.0 software is available from Forestry Suppliers, part numbers H08-032-08, H09-003-08, and BC3_7-ON. Copies of users manuals for the HOBO Pro Series Sensors, the HOBO Shuttle, and a copy of the Boxcar 4.0 Pro software is filed with the Luquillo LTER data management office. An online copy of this users manuals can be found at: ftp://ftp.onsetcomp.com/Public/Hobo_StowAway/manuals/. More information about the specifications can be found at: http://www.onsetcomp.com/Products/Product_Pages/HOBO_H08/hobo_pro_specs.html.

All sensors were launched using the same computer before being placed in the field. Sensors were set to begin operation at 0100 hours on May 6, 2000. Before placement in the field, each sensor was tested for battery strength and overall functionality. In addition, all sensors were exposed to standard conditions to compare initial calibrations. Sensors were placed inside a refrigerator, which was then allowed gradually to approach room temperature. Results of this calibration test are included in the data set with the following identifying file names.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP)</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Robert B.</givenName><surName>Waide</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>The processes that determine the plant species diversity and structure of tropical forest are still uncertain despite many years of investigation. A tropical forest characteristically has few common species and many rare species, with conspecifics often widely distributed throughout the forest. The potential for inter and intra-specific interactions are numerous, and it is difficult to determine which factors maintain species diversity or how rare species survive in the population.  Factors that we believe contribute to tropical forest structure and composition include the physical environment and past history of the forest, species-specific physiological requirements for light, nutrients and water necessary for growth, survival and reproduction, and pathogens and herbivores.  Despite the substantial amount of information available about these factors, we are still unable to accurately model the current composition of tropical forest or to predict its future response to human and natural disturbances. 

 The Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), previously known as the Hurricane Recovery Plot (Zimmerman et. al. 1994) and the Luquillo long-term ecological research grid (Soil Survey 1995), is a 16-ha forest plot (SW corner 18&#194;&#176; 20&#226;&#128;&#153; N, 65&#194;&#176; 49&#226;&#128;&#153; W) located near El Verde Field Station. The plot is 500 m N-S and 320 m E-W and is divided into 400 20 x 20 m quadrats, with each quadrat sub divided into 16 5 x 5 m sub-quadrats.  The field station and LFDP are in the Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico, approximately 35 km southeast of San Juan.  Information from the LFDP contributes to the efforts of the Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS, Smithsonian) network of large tropical forest plots in order to improve our understanding of tropical forest and to predict its future.  Large plots (typically 50 ha) are required to cover local environmental variation, include sufficient numbers of individuals of both the common and rare species, and to determine plant spatial relationships.  Population monitoring is required over many years to elucidate tree life histories, species interactions and population changes in order to determine the forest response to environmental changes and disturbance.

 The LFDP is unique among the CTFS sites as it has a history of land use disturbance and also hurricane damage. These two disturbance types interact and influence the community dynamics and species composition in the LFDP.  The Northern area (approximately two thirds of the plot) was disturbed by tree felling and farming until 1934 when the land was purchased by United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. The Southern third was not farmed and only suffered relatively light disturbance from selective logging. Aerial photographs taken in 1936 show differences in canopy cover caused by the patterns of land use history.  Clear patterns in the distribution of some species reflect this land use history (Thompson et. al. in press).  The distribution of species as a result of the land use history interacts with hurricane disturbance, as those species colonizing the northern part of the LFDP are more susceptible to hurricane damage (Zimmerman et. al. 1994). Major hurricanes struck the forest area of the LFDP in 1928 and 1932 and after a 66 year period with relatively little hurricane damage, the forest was struck by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Georges in 1998, both hurricanes causing significant damage.
