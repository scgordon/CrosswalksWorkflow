A point-quadrat system was used to estimate the cover frequencies for each species in plots in the 2 communities on the south slope of Niwot Ridge. Treatments were N, P, N+P, and control. Observations were made once per year per plot over  a period of several years. Diversity (Shannon-Weaver) indices were  also calculated.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>fertilization</keyword><keyword>species composition</keyword><keyword>species diversity</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?fertcovs.tt</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1990-07-03</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2000-07-24</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription /><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The initial iteration of the documentation section of this file was developed by Rick Ingersoll on 11-15 February 1994.

TT met with Rick  Ingersoll in early June 1995 and pointed out that number of species present was exceedingly high for many of the 1991-92 dry meadow surveys. Subsequently, it was discovered that because of the varied personnel involved in collecting the five years of data, in  combination with a variety of hard-copy data and EasyEntry data entry forms, some of the species which were neither "hit" nor  observed as being present were entered as 000 (rather than 999)  "hits". Thus, for a subset of these data, all of the species listed on the hard-copy data forms were considered as being  present. The raw EasyEntry files were corrected (all 000 hits converted to 999 hits) and the raw data were reprocessed.
