Changing economics led to the abandonment of pastures and croplands on sites with steep slopes and less-fertile soils. Since 1950 land cover on many sites has changed from nonforest to forest, resulting in greater coverage and less fragmentation of forest habitats. We hypothesized that sites with younger, aggrading forests may not yet support many of the plant species present in older forests. Therefore, we compared the diversity and abundance of vascular plants at two types of presently forested sites: (a) sites with forest established pre-1950 and (b) sites with forest established after 1950. We found that species richness for both woody and herbaceous plants was lower at sites with post-1950 forests. Species with limited dispersal capabilities or specialized habitat needs were absent from these sites. Generalist species were frequently present in these young forests but in lower densities. Many exotic, weedy species persisted in post-1950 forests. Differences between the two types of forests were mitigated by topographic factors, proximity to older forests, and land use history.</para><para>Paired study plots were selected using maps of forest cover in 1950 and 1990 provided by Paul Bolstad. Each pair of plots had one member in a pre-1950 forest stand and one member in a post 1950 forest stand. Plots were located as to minimize topographic and edaphic differences between the two members of the pair. Twenty-four pairs of plots were sampled in June 1997. Study

plots were 0.10 ha in area. The diversity and abundance of forest herb and shrub species were recorded in nine 0.5 m2 quadrats. The percent coverage (of the ground) was visually estimated for each species in each quadrat. All trees occurring in a 20 x 20 m area within the plot were recorded. Diameter at breast height (dbh) was recorded for individuals &gt;10 cm dbh.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>land use</keyword><keyword>habitat fragmentation</keyword><keyword>landscape context</keyword><keyword>herbaceous species</keyword><keyword>dispersal</keyword><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>succession</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary4012_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>French Broad River Basin, Ivy Creek Watershed.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
