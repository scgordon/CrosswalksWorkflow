                cartographic information in a raster form. The DEMs consist of an array of
                elevations for ground positions at regularly spaced intervals. The data are produced
                in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks from either digitized cartographic map contour overlays
                of a scanned National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) photographs. The DEM data
                are stored as profiles with a 10- or 30-meter square grid spacing along and between
                each profile. The original USGS DEM data (Mt. Kineo and Woodstock quadrangles) were
                merged and projected into UTM Zone 19. The resultant grid was clipped to a box
                surrounding the USDA Forest Service, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="theme">DEM</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Digital elevation model</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">US Forest Service</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Digital terrain model</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Hypsography</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Altitude</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Height</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Contour</keyword><keyword keywordType="place">Hubbard Brook</keyword><keyword keywordType="place">New Hampshire</keyword><keywordThesaurus>None</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><additionalInfo><para>http://www.hubbardbrook.org/research/gis/coverages/hb10mdem.gif</para></additionalInfo><intellectualRights><para>The USDA Forest Service manages resource information and derived data as a service

                        the collection of standard U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Elevation
                        Models (DEMs) vary depending on the systems used at the contractor,
                        cooperator or National Mapping Division (NMD) production sites. This process
                        step describes, in general, the process used in the production of standard
                        USGS DEM datasets. Level 1 DEM: Level 1 DEMs are acquired
                        photogrammetrically by manual profiling or image correlation techniques from
                        either the National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) or equivalent source
                        photographs. Level 1 30-minute DEMs may be derived or resampled from Level 1
                        7.5- minute DEMs. Level 2 DEM: Level 2 DEMs are produced by converting
                        1:24,000-scale and 1:100,000-scale hypsography digital line graph (DLG) data
                        into DEM format or the DEMs can be generated from vector data derived from
                        scanned raster files of USGS 1:24.000-scale or 1:100,000-scale map series
                        contour separates. Level 3 DEM: Level 3 DEMs are created from DLG data that
                        has been vertically integrated with all categories of hypsography,
                        hydrography, ridge line, break line, drain files and all vertical and
                        horizontal control networks. The production of Level 3 DEMs requires a
                        system of logic incorporated into the software interpolation algorithms that
                        clearly differentiates and correctly interpolates between the various types
                        of terrain, data densities and data distribution. Water body editing: DEM
                        surface areas corresponding to water bodies are flattened and assigned
                        either map specified or estimated surface elevations. Water body areas are
                        defined as ponds, lakes, and reservoirs that exceed 0.5 inches at map scale
                        and double line drainage that exceeds 0.25 inches at map scale. Water body
                        shorelines are derived from either a hypsographic DLG or by interactive
                        delineation from a 1:24,000- or 1:100,000-scale USGS map series. DEMs are
                        verified for physical format and logical consistency.</para></description><citation scope="document"><title>7.5 minute Digital Elevation Models</title><creator scope="document"><organizationName>US Geological Survey</organizationName></creator><pubDate>2001-01-01</pubDate><map><scale>24000</scale></map></citation></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=HBR,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><spatialRaster id="hb10mdem" scope="document"><entityName>hb10mdem</entityName><physical scope="document"><objectName>Elevation</objectName><dataFormat><externallyDefinedFormat><formatName>Raster Dataset</formatName></externallyDefinedFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://www.hubbardbrook.org/research/gis/gisexe/hb10mdem.exe</url></online></distribution></physical><attributeList><attribute id="Elevation" scope="document"><attributeName>Value</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Elevation above mean sea level</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="http://www.esri.com/metadata/esriprof80.html">ESRI</storageType><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>meter</standardUnit></unit><precision>2</precision><numericDomain><numberType>integer</numberType><bounds><maximum exclusive="false">1004</maximum></bounds><bounds><minimum exclusive="false">168</minimum></bounds></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>-999</code><codeExplanation>no data available</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute id="Count" scope="document"><attributeName>Count</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Number of cells that have this value in the grid</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="http://www.esri.com/metadata/esriprof80.html">ESRI</storageType><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>dimensionless</standardUnit></unit><precision>0</precision><numericDomain><numberType>integer</numberType><bounds><maximum exclusive="false">1368</maximum></bounds><bounds><minimum exclusive="false">1</minimum></bounds></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>-999</code><codeExplanation>no data available</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute></attributeList><spatialReference scope="document"><horizCoordSysName>NAD_1927_UTM_Zone_19N</horizCoordSysName></spatialReference><horizontalAccuracy><accuracyReport>The horizontal accuracy of the DEM is expressed as an estimated root

                    accuracy tests of the DEM source materials that are selected as equal to or less
                    than the intended horizontal RMSE error of the DEM. The testing of source
                    material horizontal accuracy is accomplished by comparing the planimetric (X and
                    Y) coordinates of well-defined ground points with the coordinates of the same
                    points as determined from a source of higher accuracy. 1

                    accuracy of a DEM and encompasses both random and systematic errors introduced
                    during production of the data. The RMSE is encoded in element number 5 of record
                    C of the DEM. Accuracy is computed by a comparison of linear interpolated
                    elevations in the DEM with corresponding known elevations. Test points are well
                    distributed, representative of the terrain, and have true elevations with
                    accuracies well within the DEM accuracy criteria. Acceptable test points
                    include, in order of preference: field control, aerotriangulated test points,
                    spot elevations, or points on contours from existing source maps with
                    appropriate contour interval. A minimum of 28 test points per DEM is required to
                    compute the RMSE, which is composed of a single test using 20 interior points
                    and 8 edge points. Edge points are those which are located along, at, or near
                    the quadrangle neatlines and are deemed by the editor to be useful to evaluating
                    the accuracy of the edge of the DEM. Collection of test point data and
                    comparison of the DEM with the quadrangle hypsography are conducted by the
                    quality control units within the USGS. There are three types of DEM vertical
                    errors: blunder, systematic, and random. These errors are reduced in magnitude
                    by editing but cannot be completely eliminated. Blunder errors are those errors
                    of major proportions and are easily identified and removed during interactive
                    editing. Systematic errors are those errors that follow some fixed pattern and
                    are introduced by data collection procedures and systems. Random errors result
                    from unknown or accidental causes. 2 meter(s)</accuracyReport></verticalAccuracy><cellSizeXDirection>10.000000</cellSizeXDirection><cellSizeYDirection>10.000000</cellSizeYDirection><numberOfBands>1</numberOfBands><rasterOrigin>Upper Left</rasterOrigin><rows>840</rows><columns>1320</columns><verticals>1</verticals><cellGeometry>matrix</cellGeometry></spatialRaster></dataset></ns0:eml>
