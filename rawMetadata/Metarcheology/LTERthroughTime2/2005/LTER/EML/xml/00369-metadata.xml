<abstract>
<para>
The U.S. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) operates hundreds of Snotel sites throughout the western United States. One of these is on  Niwot Ridge at C-1, located approximately 1.6 km, by road, from the  University of Colorado Mountain Research Station at an approximate elevation of 3000 meters. The Snotel installations operate on the  principle that the snowpack exerts pressure on liquid-filled stainless  steel "pillows" that rest on the ground. Pressure transducers output a  digital signal that is sent via radio telemetry to one of two receiving  stations. The transducer output is calibrated by measuring snowpack  depth and density on or about the 25th of each month from December through April. A Mt. Rose snow sampler was used to determine the depth and density of the snowpack at each of the "pillow's" four corners. These four values were averaged to determine the monthly snow water  equivalent (SWE) in inches. </para>

					<para>These data were manually entered using an EasyEntry form and
						then processed on niwotlter, the NWT LTER workstation. 
						Additional snow water equivalent data for Niwot Ridge can be found in 
						http://niwot.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?snowateq.mw
						A new scale was used beginning with the 31 December 1997 measurement.
						On 30 May 1997, field personnel made the following notation:
						There is still snow at C1. The northern two corners are melted out,
						the snow depth at the southeast corner is 55 cm, and the Snotel
						homepage (http://wrcc.sage.dri.edu/index.html) reports 6.1 inches 
						of telemetered snow water equivalence at this site today (200%).
						On 2 June 1997, field personnel made the following notation:
						The nothern half of the Snotel pillow rectangle was snow-free, and 
						the NE corner depth was 30 cm (deepest corner depth). The Snotel 
						telemetered snow water equivalent, via their homepage 
						(http://wrcc.sage.dri.edu/index.html), was 1.5 inches (94%).  
						Field personnel reported that the Snotel site was 100% snowfree
						on 2 June 1998.
						Field personnel reported that 1 December 1998 there was 20 cm snow 
						depth measured at the Snotel site, and the Snotel web page showed 
						1.1" SWE, for 37% average.
						Note: Snow depths and water contents were recorded in inches. The
						calculated means for those 2 variables are in centimeters.</para>
