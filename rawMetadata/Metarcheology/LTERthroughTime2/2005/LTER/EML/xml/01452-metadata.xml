We measured litterfall, leaf breakdown, and floodplain litter at 12 sites. Annual litterfall (274-625 g m-2 y-1) was typical of a temperate deciduous forest but lower than lowland floodplain forests in the eastern United States. Leaf breakdown rates of 4 tree species ranged from 0.001-0.010 d-1. Following a flood on 8 January 1998, the 12 sites were separated into 3 classes of inundation: inundated, partially-inundated, and non-inundated. Sites inundated by the flood had significantly less floodplain leaf litter and large woody material after the flood. There was no significant change at the partially-inundated or non-inundated sites. In addition, there was no significant difference in herbaceous litter between pre- and post-flood collections at any site. The flood also increased leaf breakdown rates of red maple (Acer rubrum) and black walnut (Juglans nigra) but had no effect on American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana) or sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). Our measurements of litterfall, leaf breakdown, and floodplain litter suggest that flood entrainment of POM from the floodplain of Little Tennessee River is a source of POM to the active channel. However, floodplain POM inputs were a small annual source of POM for the river compared to direct litterfall.</para><para>Litter inputs to the floodplain | Ten litter traps were placed at each of the 12 sites at 2-m intervals along a transect parallel to the river channel located approximately 2 m from the river bank. Litter traps consisted of a 0.25-m2 frame fitted with 1-mm mesh fiberglass screen and supported by three wooden stakes. Litter was removed from the traps twice monthly during times of peak leaffall (October-November) and monthly at other times from September 1997 until September 1998.  Litter was dried (50 degrees C, 2 d) and separated into leaves, wood, and miscellaneous litter (e.g., flowers, seeds). Leaves were sorted to species, weighed, recombined, ground, and subsampled. Wood and miscellaneous litter were separately weighed, ground, and subsampled. Subsamples were weighed, ashed (550 degrees C, 45 min), and reweighed to determine ash free dry mass (AFDM). | Leaf breakdown | Fifteen leaf bags of the 2 most common floodplain species, sycamore and American hornbeam, were placed on the floodplain at 8 of the 12 sites, and 15 leaf bags of 2 other common floodplain species, red maple and black walnut, were placed at 3 sites. Leaf bags of a given species were placed at sites where that species was common. Each leaf bag initially contained 8 g of leaf material. Three bags of American hornbeam, black walnut, and red maple were retrieved after 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 mo at each site, and 3 leaf bags of sycamore were collected after 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9 mo at each site. All leaves were washed, dried, weighed, ground, and subsampled. Subsamples were weighed, ashed, and reweighed to determine AFDM. Species-specific exponential rates of breakdown were determined from the negative slope of the log percentage AFDM remaining (y-axis) vs. the days of exposure (x-axis) (e.g. Benfield 1996).  | Floodplain litter standing crop | Floodplain litter standing crop (FPL) was measured by removing all coarse litter from 20 0.05-m2 plots at each site (240 total plots) in December 1997 (pre-flood) and January 1998 (post-flood). Litter was dried and separated into leaves, wood, and herbaceous material. Sorted materials were then weighed, ground, and subsampled to determine AFDM.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>river</keyword><keyword>floodplain</keyword><keyword>decomposition</keyword><keyword>breakdown</keyword><keyword>litterfall</keyword><keyword>organic matter</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary4017_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Sites along the Little Tennessee River in Macon and Swain counties || Site Location Site code River km | Saw Mill rt 441 south of Riverside Rd.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
