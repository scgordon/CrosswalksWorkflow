McDowell and Estrada-Pinto, 1988 presents a description of the collection procedures, raw data from 1964 to 1986, and some summary statistics for this period of record. Precipitation for this period showed some seasonality in monthly means, with a peak in May. Monthly averages for the period of 1975 to 2000 charts can be found at (http:/sunites.upr.clu.edu/sunceer/DATA/LUQMetadata14/metadata/1975-2000MonthlyAvg-byyear.jpg). The highest values for the monthly averages for the period of 1975 to 2000 are from August to December with a low in October and November the highest. In this period the highest amount of total annual rainfall was in 1998 with 528.5 cm and the minimum in 1994 with 141.6 cm.(see graph)</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>EL VERDE Field Station</keyword><keyword>LEF</keyword><keyword>precipitation</keyword><keyword>rainfall</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE</keyword><keyword>EL VERDE</keyword><keyword>REPORT</keyword><keyword>TABONUCO</keyword><keyword>Primary Productivity</keyword><keyword>Environmental Monitoring</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>ADEQUATE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><para><literalLayout>The scientists, the LEF-LTER Program, and the                                     USDA International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) must                                     receive adequate acknowledgement for the use of data by other                                     scientists, and the LEF LTER program must receive two copies of                                     any publication using that data.

It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Eda</givenName><surName>Mel&#195;&#169;ndez-Colom</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Puerto Rico</organizationName><positionName>Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies (ITES)</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.O.

Meteorological sensors were installed at the El Verde Field Station's flat concrete rooftop, 3 m above the ground surface at an elevation of 350 m asl after the September 1989 (Hugo) hurricane.
