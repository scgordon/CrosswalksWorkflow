and Oksrukuyik Creek we used a combination of stainless steel (SS) and PVC 
wells.  A description of the SS wells and their sampling protocol is contained 
in the LTER file "90BOHYPO.DOC".  The PVC wells were constructed from 6 ft. 
lengths of 1/2 in. O.D. PVC tubing.  A polypropylene wellpoint was fixed to 
the bottom end of  each well.  Above this wellpoint 4 in. of the PVC tube was 
slotted every 1/4 in.  Slot width was 0.006 in.  PVC wells were inserted by 
using a pry bar to create a narrow gap in the streambed cobbles.   As the pry 
bar was removed, the PVC well was quickly inserted in much the same manner as 
the SS wells were installed.  Wells were installed to the deepest depth 
possible.  PVC wells were sampled with a length of 1/8 in. I.D X 1/16 in. wall 
Tygon tubing lowered into the well.  All water was removed by drawing up 
slowly with a 60 cc B.D. syringe.  This water was discarded and the well was 
allowed to refill; refill time was variable, ranging from minutes to hours.  
After refilling, wells were sampled a second time.  Well water was withdrawn 
into a syringe and a 0.45 um pore size, 25 mm diameter syringe filter attached 
to the syringe tip.  The filter was rinsed with 10 ml of sample and the 
remaining sample filtered into an acid-washed 125 ml polypropylene bottle.  
Samples were refrigerated at Toolik Camp until nutrient analysis could be 
completed on the autoanalyzer.   We noted that adult insects (dead) collected 
in the wells and so all PVC wells were removed, cleaned, and reinstalled.  
Nutrient concentrations from PVC wells on the first two sampling dates of both 
rivers are suspect because of contamination of the insects.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Notes: These data should not be released to any party
