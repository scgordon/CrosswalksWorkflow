phosphorus addition 0.75 km downstream to stream benchmark +1.4 km.  This created 3 
treatment reaches: a reference reach (upstream of +0.59 km), a P-recovery reach (+0.59 to 
+1.35 km), and a long-term P-fertilized reach (1.35 to 10 km).  Further downstream 
(typically &amp;gt; 10 km) nutrient conditions return to background concentrations (Peterson et 
al. 1993, Bowden et al. 1994).  From each of these treatment reaches we have chosen 3 
riffles from which to sample. 
	For 8 consecutive weeks during the 1996 field season, total chlorophyll content of 
S. agassizii and Hygrohypnum spp. was determined.  Each week collections of S. 
agassizii were retrieved from 3 riffles in each treatment reach and collections of 
Hygrohypnum spp. were retrieved from each of the designated 3 riffles in the recovery 
and fertilized reaches.  Hygrohypnum spp. is rarely found in the reference zone and was 
therefore not included.  Two, small, thumb-sized clumps of each species were randomly 
collected from each of the study riffles, rinsed to remove loose epiphytes, detritus, and 
invertebrates, and placed in a whirl-pak bag and transported to the laboratory.  Because S. 
agassizii can be found on rocks that are more frequently exposed to the atmosphere than 
Hygrohypnum spp. an effort was made to collect clumps from permanently submerged 
substrate. 
	At the laboratory 1 frond from each of the collected clumps was randomly 
selected for chlorophyll extraction.  Each frond was patted dry and weighed on a Cahn C-
33 microbalance to record the fresh mass and then placed in 10 ml of 100 % DMSO for 
40-48 hours for chlorophyll extraction (Alpert 1984, Hains 1985, Spencer and Ksander 
1987).  Chlorophyll was determined spectrophotometrically following methods and 
equations of Golterman (1969).  Absorbency was read at 665 nm and (to correct for 
turbidity) at 750 nm.  Samples were not acidified and thus, measurements represent total 
chlorophyll content. 
	Ten additional fronds from each species were selected to develop a wet weight to 
dry weight relationship.  The fronds ranged in size from small to large and each frond 
was weighed separately.  After weighing, all fronds were dried at 65.0 oC to a consistent 
weight and re-weighed individually.  Regression analysis was used to quantify the wet to 
dry relationship for each species.  This relationship was established weekly for both 
species. 
	Total chlorophyll concentrations were converted to dry mass specific estimates 
using the established wet to dry weight relationship and the equation is described below 
(Calculations).</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Notes: These data should not be released to any party without
