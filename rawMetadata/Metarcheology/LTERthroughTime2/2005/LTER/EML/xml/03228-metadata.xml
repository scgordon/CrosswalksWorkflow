Sulfate adsorption and organic S formation potentials were estimated. Overall, the potential for adsorption of sulfate was greater than the formation potential. Twenty-nine to sixty percent of the added sulfate was adsorbed in the soil. Of the recently formed organic S, the majority was ester sulfate (74-84%). The sediment samples had the greatest formation potential when related to carbon concentration. The intrinsic sulfur pools of these samples were also measured. Total S (ester and carbon bonded S) ranged from 121 ug S/g dwt to 758 ug S/g dwt. With one exception, the majority of the total intrinsic S was carbon bonded (44-73%). No stream distance dependent or seasonal trends have been seen with adsorption and formation potentials or with intrinsic S concentrations.</para><para>A-horizon soils in WS 55 were sampled seasonally over the past two years. We have three transects approximately 20 meters apart from each other that cross the stream. Seven samples were taken from each transect on the north and south side of the stream including a sediment sample, and samples from

0.5 m, 5 m, and 20 m from the stream. Samples were assayed for adsorption and formation potentials and for intrinsic S concentrations within two weeks of the sampling date. To estimate sulfate adsorption and organic S formation potentials, the soils and sediments were incubated with 35S for 48 hours. An extraction procedure was utilized to quantify mobile S, adsorbed sulfate, and recently formed organic S. Intrinsic total sulfur pools were determined using a hypobromite oxidation procedure (total S). Organically bound ester sulfate and inorganic S were determined by direct reduction by hydriodic

acid (HI reducible S). The carbon-bonded S component of the total S pool was calculated by subtracting the HI reducible S from the total S.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>sulfur processing</keyword><keyword>intrinsic S pools</keyword><keyword>Organic S formation</keyword><keyword>sulfate adsorption potentials</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary2009_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>WS 55</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1996-06-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-01-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
