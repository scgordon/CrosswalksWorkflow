Statistical models have been developed to relate temperature and precipitation to leaf morphological and wood anatomical characteristics. Now these models need to be thoroughly tested to determine their validity and precision. | The proposed work entails the collection of leaves and associated wood from native angiosperms in forested areas whose climate parameters are known. The physiognomy of leaves and wood will be used, in conjunction with existing climate models, to estimate temperature; these estimates will be compared with actual site temperature to determine the accuracy of the models and to refine their precision.</para><para>At least 20 native species (preferably more if more species are present) of dicotyledonous trees, shrubs and woody lianas will be selected at each site. Each tree will be assigned an identification number, and approximately 10 leaves will be collected. Leaves will be collected by clipping the tip of a small branch or from the ground. The leaves will be preserved in a plant press immediately to be later archived in our collection. Secondary xylem samples will then be removed from each tree using a 12 mm increment borer. The hole left by the borer will be left open or plugged with modeling clay dependent on the requirements of the station. The wood samples will be preserved in %50 ethanol in glass jars.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>wood anatomy</keyword><keyword>climate prediction</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>leaf physiognomy</keyword><keyword>North America</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1061_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>We would like to gather leaves and wood cores throughout the reserve.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
