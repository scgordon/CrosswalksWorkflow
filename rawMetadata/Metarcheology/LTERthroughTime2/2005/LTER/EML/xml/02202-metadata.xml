It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Nicolas V.L.</givenName><surName>Brokaw</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Puerto Rico</organizationName><positionName>LUQ LTER Director</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies (ITES)</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.O.

Thirty two  plots were located by one of three rivers, the Sonadora, Icacos, and Mamayes.  Plots were located at 50m intervals along the rivers.  To locate a plot, the elevation of a site was determined using a GPS receiver while standing in the river, and the plot was established by moving into the forest from the river, and staking out a corner at that elevation, as soon as we were out of the immediate riparian zone.  The long axis of each plot runs parallel to the contours of the slope.  Using a field tape, each plot was divided into ten 10mx10m quadrats (in two rows of five), and then each quadrat was further subdivided into four 5mx5m subquadrats.  Every free-standing woody stem greater than 1 cm dbh was marked, using a individually numbered metal tag tied to the plant using green horticulture tape.  The diameter of the stem was measured at 130cm above the ground, and the stem was identified to species.  The numbers for each plot were independent, starting over at 1.  At the conclusion of each plot four corner posts were left in the ground, with a metal tag tied to its top, to help with re-location.  (A more detailed protocol is available from John A. Barone.)</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Community Composition of Plants</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>John</givenName><surName>Barone</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>The composition of plant communities changes with elevation in the Luquillo Experimental Forest.  The goal of this project is to document the patterns of these changes, and in particular, to determine whether the distributions of individual species are independent of one another, or whether they are related, in either a congruent or a hierarchical manner.  Twenty-four permanent vegetation plots, each 50m by 20m are being established in the LEQ, with eight plots each along three rivers, the Sonadora, Icacos, and Mamayes.  The  plots are being established at every 100m in elevation, starting at 200m above sea level.  All woody, free-standing stems greater than 1cm dbh are being marked, identified and mapped into 5x5 subquadrats.  We anticipate that gradient analysis will show whether the distributions of species are coincident or independent, enabling us to evaluate whether separate, genuine plant communities exist in the LEQ.   Because the plots are permanent, we also expect that they will also us to better evaluate how different vegetation types, at different elevations, respond to large scale disturbances, especially hurricanes.</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>LTER</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></ns0:eml>
