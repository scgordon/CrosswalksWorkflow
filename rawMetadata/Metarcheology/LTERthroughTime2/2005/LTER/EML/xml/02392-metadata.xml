sites situated in one pool/riffle continuum in both the Kuparuk River and
Oksrukuyik Creek.  The wells were of a significantly different design than the
stainless steel (SS) and PVC samplers used in 1990 and 1991.  The tops of the
wells, approximately 4-5 ft. risers, were constructed from 1/2 in. PVC tubing. 
The well bottoms were constructed from 5 in. of 1/2 in PVC slotted every 1/4
in.  The slots were 0.006 in. wide.  The slotted PVC was attached to the riser
at the top and a polypropylene (PP) well point at the bottom.  The slotted PVC
and the riser were separated by a silicon stopper which prevented exposure of
hyporheic water to the atmosphere.  A 5 to 6 ft. length of 1/8 in. SS tubing
extended from the slotted PVC chamber through the stopper to several inches
above the top of the well (riser).  A stopper at the top of the well prevented
rain water from entering the riser.  The bottom end of the SS was open; the top
end was attached to a 1/8 in. Swagelok to a 1/8 in. female NPT fitting.  This,
in turn, was attached to a 1/8 in. male NPT to 1/8 in. I.D. plastic hose barb. 
Approximately 2 in. of 1/8 in plastic tubing was attached tightly to the hose
barb fitting.  The sampling port, a three-way Pharmaseal stopcock, was inserted
into the end of the plastic tubing.  The sampling apparatus was air-tight 
Wells were inserted by using a pry bar to create a narrow gap in the streambed
cobbles.  As the pry bar was carefully removed, the PVC well was quickly
inserted to the deepest depth possible, usually 30-70 cm.  Wells were located
in a grid consisting of 5 to 7 rows, with 2 to 4 wells across each row.  Well
locations andelevations were mapped in both rivers using a field level and
stadia, and referencing all points in each river to a fixed common point. 
Wells were notsampled for several weeks after installation.  To sample wells
for nutrients, wells were first purged by drawing slowly on a 60 cc B.D.
syringe; following this, up to 100 ml of water was withdrawn and immediately
filtered through a 0.45 um, 25 mm syringe filter into an acid-washed 125 ml
polypropylene bottle.  Filters were first flushed with 5 to 10 ml of sample,
which was discarded.  Nutrient samples were stored on ice until they could be
refrigerated at Toolik Camp prior to analysis with the autoanalyzer.  After the
nutrient sample was removed from the well, a hand pump was used to pull water
into a vacuum flask to measure conductivity, pH, and dissolved oxygen.  Well
water slowly filled a 30 ml glass vial in the flask and was allowed to overflow
several times into the flask.  The vial was carefully removed from the flask to
avoid entraining air bubbles in the sample, capped, sealed with Parafilm, and
stored on ice.  Conductivity and pH were immediately measured on the sample
remaining in the flask.  At Toolik Camp, the vial was opened and dissolved
oxygen measured using the Solomat datalogger and MacKreth DO probes with a
stirrer.  DO was typically measured within 2 to 3 hours of sample collection. 
Small amounts of sediment in these samples did not appear to create a
measureable oxygen demand.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Notes: These data should not be released to any party without
