Fish habitat has apparently benefited substantially from the increasing levels of forest cover that have occurred in the region over the past 50 years due to the reversion of former cropland and pastureland to forest. However, recent research has shown that even though the area of forest cover has increased, there have been concurrent increases in human activity and land fragmentation. Fragmentation is the result of increasing primary and second home development in the region as people seek to enjoy the high quality environment and ambience of the region. Unfortunately, land fragmentation and build-up can result in pollution and stream deterioration, threaten fish habitat and native biodiversity, and ultimately affect the recreational use of streams that individuals come to the region for. Of substantial concern to researchers and planners is what drives land use change. We hypothesize that streams and their ability to provide trout habitat and fishing opportunities may help determine land use in the north Georgia mountain counties of the Southern Appalachian Blue Ridge.</para><para>Compiling GIS coverages of vegetation cover, elevation, potential trout-bearing streams, ownership, and cultural features (roads, trails, etc.) for 12 counties in north Georgia (Dawson, Fannin, Gilmer, Habersham, Murray, Lumpkin, Pickens, Rabun, Stephens, Towns, White, Union) from existing sources. | Compiling social and economic information for 12 counties in north Georgia from National Census records. | Compiling contemporary land transaction information on land holdings from multiple real estate listing service for 12 counties in north Georgia for period 1992-1997 for all parcels equal to or greater than 3 acres. | Compiling historical chain-of-owner and pricing information on selected land holdings in Habersham and Towns counties from county courthouses. | Mail survey of owner characteristics, management practices, and attitudes influencing land use for selected trout/non-trout bearing areas of Habersham and Towns counties</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>recreational fishing</keyword><keyword>land use</keyword><keyword>land value</keyword><keyword>habitat fragmentation</keyword><keyword>hedonic modeling</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary4009_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>None Available</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1997-09-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1999-08-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
