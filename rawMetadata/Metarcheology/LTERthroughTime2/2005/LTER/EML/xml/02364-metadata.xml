collected through hyporheic samplers installed to either a pool 
riffle pool sequence(Kuparuk fert. and ref, Oksrukuyik ref.) or a 
point bar(Oksrukuyik fert.).  In Imnavait creek samples were 
drawn through stainless steel canulas. 
Well Construction/Installation:  Hyporheic samplers consisted of 
a 1/8 inch O.D. stainless steel (S.S.) tube housed in a 3/4 inch 
CPVC pipe.  At the lower end of the CPVC a rubber stopper was 
inserted with the S.S tube protruding ten centimeters.  A coupler 
was then used to attach a length of well screen to protect the 
S.S. tube.  Tygon tubing was slid onto the top end of the S.S 
tubing and a three-way Pharmaseal stopcock was inserted into the 
tubing.  Samplers were inserted into the stream bed by forcing a 
pry bar into the stream bed  to a depth of the maximum depth 
allowed, typically 30-60 centimeters.  The sampler was then 
worked down into the hole and the pry bar removed, allowing the 
hole to backfill around the sampler.  The length of the sampler, 
still above the substrate, was measured and subtracted from the 
total length to find the depth of the sampler in the substrate.  
Samplers were allowed to settle before any testing occurred.
Sample collection:  In Imnavait creek hyporheic samples were 
drawn out of the sediment with a 50 centimeter long, 1/8 inch 
O.D. stainless steel canula, machined to attach to a standard 60 
mL syringe(Luer-lock).  In all other streams samples were 
collected via a 60 mL syringe directly from the hyporheic sampler 
after drawing 30 mL out to purge the interior of the sampler. 
Samples were filtered through a 25 mm diameter 0.45 um  cellulose 
acetate syringe filter in the field.
Sample analysis:  Specific conductivity was measured in the field 
on a VWR model 2052 conductivity meter.  All chemical sample 
analysis was done within 24 hours of collection and stored cold 
during the interim period.  Ammonia-nitrogen concentrations were 
determined by the phenate method.  Nitrate-nitrogen was 
determined by cadmium reduction.  Phosphate-phosphorous was 
determined by the ascorbic acid method.  Dissolved oxygen was 
determined with a Solomat dissolved oxygen meter.  Temperature 
was measured with a Omega 871 digital thermometer.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Notes: For the Kuparuk River samples the series 
variables are: R=Right, L=Left, P=Pool, B=Bank. For Oksrukuyik 
Creek samples the series variables are: OCR=Oksrukuyik Creek 
Riffle, OCPB1= Oksrukuyik Creek Point Bar #1, Oksrukuyik Creek 
Point Bar #2. For the Imnavait Creek samples the series variables 
are: IC1=Imnaviat Creek series 1, and IC2= Imnavait Creek series 
2.   
All distances are relative to the established river markings.
