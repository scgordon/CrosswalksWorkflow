Sediment volumes have been estimated by the 3-dimensional cross-sectional area basis since 1956. However, data from 1960, 61, 62, and 64 are missing. It is unknown whether the data for 1963 and 1965 are for single or multiple years. Sediment mass was determined by collecting subsamples during the volume measurements. These subsamples were of measured volume. They were oven-dried and a volume to dry weight conversion was made for the entire basin based on the conversion factor of the subsample. For most years only one subsample was collected. Weir 1 is a 90 deg. sharp-crested V-notch weir with a 2-foot notch, but it is a very shallow weir and may not retain as much sediment as the others of the same type. Sediment mass data were estimated from 1975 - present.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>WS-2
Cross-sectional sediment volumes were estimated from 1957-1959. Data are missing from 1960-1964. Cross-sectional data are available for 1965. Volume data for 1966, 67, 68, 70, and 71 were provided by Yale by measuring all sediment in containers of known volume. Data are missing for 1969, and for 1972-75. For the period 1976-present volumes were estimated using the 3-dimensional cross-sectional area method. Sediment mass data for the period 1966-1973 were estimated by actual weighing all of the sediment wet, and drying subsamples to obtain a wet/dry weight ratio by Yale University. Mass data are missing for 1974-1975. Mass for 1976-present was estimated by the volume/dry weight method usually with only one subsample. Weir 2 is fitted with a 2-foot 120 deg. sharp crested V-notch with a large basin. But the watershed was clear-felled in 1965, and treated with herbicides for 3 years. Since 1965, the forest has been regrowing.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>WS-3
Sediment volume has been estimated by the 3-dimensional cross-sectional area method since 1958. Data are missing for 1960-62 and for 1964.

The watershed is the untreated hydrologic reference watershed.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>WS-4
Sediment volume has been estimated by the 3-dimensional cross-sectional area method since 1965. Sediment mass has been estimated by the volume/dry weight method since 1975. Weir 4 is fitted with a 2-foot 120 deg. sharp crested V-notch. One third of the watershed was harvested in 25m wide strips in 1970, 1972, and 1974, and is now regrowing.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>WS-5
Sediment volume was estimated by the 3-dimensional cross-sectional area method during 1965-1983. There are no volume data after 1983. Sediment mass was estimated by the volume/dry weight method during 1975-1983. From 1984-present, mass was estimated by weighing all the sediment wet and drying subsamples to obtain a wet/dry sediment weight factor. In 1976, Bob Bilby removed the debris dams from the lower reaches of the stream just above the weir. WS-5 is fitted with a 1-foot 90 deg. sharp crested V-notch and a modified San Dimas flume. As a result prior to October 1983 most of the sediment carried during high flow events bipassed the basin and was not caught. In October 1983, a sediment trap including a net was built immediately below the notch. The net trapped the following % of the annual
totals:
     1984 0.2%
     1985 7.4%
     1986 0.3%
     1987 0.1%</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>WS-6
Sediment volume was estimated by the 3-dimensional cross-sectional area method from 1965-1971. Data are missing for 1969. Sediment mass has been estimated from 1966 - present by weighing all sediment wet, then drying subsamples for wet/dry weight ratios. These weights have been determined by a variety of workers: Tony Dominski, Judy Meyers, Bob Bilby, USFS. Weir 6 like Weir 5 has a 1-foot 90 deg. sharp crested V-notch and a modified San Dimas flume, but no additional sediment trap. Most sediment during high flows bipasses the basin and is not sampled.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>WS-7&amp;8
Sediment volumes have been estimated by cross-sectional area in Weir 7 since 1967, and in Weir 8 since 1970. There are no missing data. Missing values indicate years when there was not enough sediment to bother cleaning. Therefore the value of 0.075 for WS-8 for 1975 represents 5 years of sediment. 0.010 for WS-7 for 1986 represents 2 years of data. WS-7 and 8 also have flumes so considerable sediment is lost at high flow. Beginning with 1990, Weirs 7 and 8 were cleaned but the sediment was neither measured nor weighed.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>WS-9
Weir 9 was built in 1994 and is cleaned annually, but the sediment is neither measured nor weighed.</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=HBR,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>sdmskgha</entityName><entityDescription>Soil sediment yield in weir basin data at Hubbard Brook LTER (in kilograms per hectare)</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>sdmskgha.txt</objectName><characterEncoding>ASCII</characterEncoding><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n\r</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://www.hubbardbrook.org/data/data_policy.php?firstname=metacat&amp;lastname=user&amp;affiliation=Other&amp;view=1&amp;accept=1&amp;comments=none&amp;phone=6035551212&amp;email=none@loopback.com&amp;target=sdmskgha.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><additionalInfo><section><para><literalLayout>The data is physically located at the USDA Forest Service, Durham, NH and was last updated on February 10, 1998.</literalLayout></para></section></additionalInfo><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>YEAR</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Year collected</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><datetime><formatString>YYYY</formatString><dateTimePrecision>1 year</dateTimePrecision><dateTimeDomain><bounds><minimum exclusive="false">1956</minimum></bounds></dateTimeDomain></datetime></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>WS-1</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Watershed 1 sediment Yeild</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>kilogramsPerHectare</standardUnit></unit><precision>.1</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>-99.9</code><codeExplanation>Data missing or not taken at this time</codeExplanation></missingValueCode><method><methodStep><description><section><para>Sediment volumes have been estimated by the 3-dimensional cross-sectional area basis since 1956.

Sediment mass was determined by collecting subsamples during the volume measurements. These subsamples were of measured volume. They were oven-dried and a volume to dry weight conversion was made for the entire basin based on the conversion factor of the subsample. For most years only one subsample was collected. Weir 1 is a 90 deg. sharp-crested V-notch weir with a 2-foot notch, but it is a very shallow weir and may not retain as much sediment as the others of the same type.

As a result prior to October 1983 most of the sediment carried during high flow events bipassed the basin and was not caught. In October 1983, a sediment trap including a net was built immediately below the notch. The net trapped the following % of the annual
