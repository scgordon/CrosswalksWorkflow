One poorly understood component of the nitrogen cycle in forest ecosystems is the contribution of phytophagous insect frass  on soil N-cycling dynamics. This study proposes to investigate the influence  of frass on 1. the dynamics of soil N-cycling; 2. the loss of N from the  ecosystem via leaching; 3. the slow cycle decomposition of post-herbivore leaf litter; and 4. the overall potential of soil near the Coweeta Hydrologic  Laboratory to retain nitrogen. Red Oak (Quercus rubra [Fagaceae]) saplings  will be subjected to defoliation by the seasonal phytophagous insect larvae of the White-Marked Tussock Moth Orgyia leucostigma Lepidoptera Lymantriidae and the frass added to the soil in a factorial, controlled experimental  design. Soil nutrient concentrations, leachate nutrient concentrations, respiration, and leaf quality will be meas red. The project is expected to increase our understanding of the complex relationship between above-ground and below-ground nitrogen cycling dynamics as well as inform the current debate concerning the relative impacts and importance of human versus natural alterations to the nitrogen cycle.</para><para>Leaf Litter will be collected from trees in the microcosm experiment described in the previous site use form. Litter from each of the treatment groups will be dried, weighed, and placed in litter bags.  The litter bags will be placed on the forest floor in a method similar to that which is reported in Kitti Reynolds doctoral dissertation.  Litter bags from each treatment will be collected every other month for decomposition analysis (e.g., mass loss, phenolic assays, microarthropod

abundances). | The major variable of interest is the influence of frass additions to soil

during the growing season on the decomposition of the subsequent leaf litter,

considering the relationship between herbivory, induced response in oaks, and

litter decomposition suggests rate of decomposition decreases with litter quality.

We are testing the hypothesis that frass additions may mediate the rate

of decomposition. So, leaf litter with herbivore damage and frass additions will

decompose more quickly than leaf litter with herbivore damage and no frass

additions.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>frass</keyword><keyword>nutrient cycling</keyword><keyword>ecosystem function</keyword><keyword>Quercus rubra</keyword><keyword>litter decomposition</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1068_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>In watershed 27, using the same site where Barbara C.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
