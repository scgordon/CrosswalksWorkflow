In forests, canopy gaps are a major source of environmental heterogeneity, providing for increased light levels that may play a central role in tree regeneration and subsequent patterns of species diversity. While many studies have examined the direct effects of canopy gaps on seedling recruitment, few have considered the interaction of other sources of spatial heterogeneity with canopy gap formation. I examine the potential for spatial heterogeneity in understory cover, mineral resources, and moisture to interact with overstory condition to contribute to species coexistence. I created microsites with contrasting resource availability by removing understory vegetation, trenching, trenching and removal of vegetation, fertilization, and unmanipulated controls. These treatments were replicated beneath closed canopy and canopy gaps. I planted 1080 seedlings of Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus rubrum in these microsites and have subsequently monitored seedling survival and growth. My results so far indicate that species and treatment greatly affect seedling survival and growth, but that species rankings do not change across treatment combinations in a manner promoting species coexistence.</para><para>None Available</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>seedlings</keyword><keyword>growth</keyword><keyword>survival</keyword><keyword>competition</keyword><keyword>gaps</keyword><keyword>understory vegetation</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1038.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>12 different sites with 2 plots per site: see gps locations below | 1) 1 site above plot 318 | 2) 1 site below lower gap plots | 3) 1 site to left of 83-b on way up to lower elevation gap plots | 4) 1 site near Eric Nilsens site off of Ball Creek Road | 5) 7 sites along Dyke Gap Road (83-d) | 6) 1 site in Barker Cove</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1997-08-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2000-05-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance
and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying
watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 
The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific
understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of
land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the
last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will
be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of
land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental
gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more
complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian
Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of
its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in
response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences
that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized
into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,
(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting
Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The
integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as
an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of
land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus
recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs
as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
