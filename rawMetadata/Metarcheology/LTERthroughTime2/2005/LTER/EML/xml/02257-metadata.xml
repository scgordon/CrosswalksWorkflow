As a result levels of herbivory on young leaves can vary throughout the year. To determine the importance of food availability on herbivory, leaf phenology and leaf damage were studied in an aseasonal forest, Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) in Puerto Rico. Leaf production was associated with an increase in light availability but leaf damage was relatively constant throughout the year. Leaf phenology and leaf damage was compared between LEF and a seasonal forest, Barro Colorado Island (BCI) Panam&#195;&#161;. In BCI leaf production was associated with increases in water availability and leaf damage was significantly higher on leaves produced after the peak in leaf production. Leaf damage was significantly lower in LEF in comparison with BCI. Differences in the trophic structure between the two forests may explain the differences in levels of leaf damage. The density of frogs and lizards in LEF was approximately an order of magnitude greater than in BCI and these predators may limit the populations of herbivores and reduce leaf damage levels.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>community</keyword><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>el verde</keyword><keyword>herbivory</keyword><keyword>DISTURBANCE</keyword><keyword>EL VERDE</keyword><keyword>HERBIVORY</keyword><keyword>PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL</keyword><keyword>TABONUCO</keyword><keyword>Population Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Disturbance Regime</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>ADEQUATE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><para><literalLayout>The scientists, the LEF-LTER Program, and the                                     USDA International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) must                                     receive adequate acknowledgement for the use of data by other                                     scientists, and the LEF LTER program must receive two copies of                                     any publication using that data.

It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Mitch</givenName><surName>Aide</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Puerto Rico</organizationName><positionName>Professor</positionName><address scope="document"><city>R&#195;&#173;o Piedras</city><administrativeArea>PR</administrativeArea><postalCode>00931-3360</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(603)862-2698</phone><electronicMailAddress>maide@upracd.upr.clu.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

Plants were located in plots along La Prieta, upper Sonadora and Ox cart trails. Two shrubs, Palicourea riparia (Rubiaceae) and Piper glabrecens (Piperaceae) and six tree species, Casearia arborea (Flacourtiaceae), Dacryodes excelsa (Burseraceae), Guarea guidonia (Meliaceae), Manilkara bidentata (Sapotaceae), Sloanea berteriana (Elaeocarpaceae) and Tabebuia heterophylla (Bignoneaceae) were studied. These species were chosen because they are among the most common species in at this site (Zimmerman et al. 1994). There have been few studies on the herbivore community of LEF, but Schowalter (1994) collected the major invertebrates associated with five common tree species and found that Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Homoptera (cicadellids principally) were the most abundant herbivores, that are the principal herbivores in different type of forest (Duckett, pers. comm.).  In addition different species of walking sticks (Phasmida) are also important herbivores in LEF (Garrison &amp;amp; Willig 1996).</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Herbivory</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Maria del Pilar</givenName><surName>Angulo</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>Long-term experiments associated with herbivory, a process which under certain circumstances may be an important regulator of detrital processing, has started at El Verde only since 2002. In addition to continuing long-term vegetation measurements will be conducted to determine long-term patterns of herbivory in two ways. As in most tropical forests, herbivores mainly eat young leaves (Coley &amp;amp; Barone 1996), which flush during May and June in the tabonuco forest or following disturbance (Angulo-Sandoval &amp;amp; Aide 2000). We will measure percent herbivory on new leaves of focal species marked each year in May and June. The second measurement will be of inputs of green leaf litter and insect frass to the forest floor. These measures will be used to gauge the changes in rates of herbivory during recovery from disturbance, with the ultimate goal of evaluating the role of herbivory in succession.  In addition, herbivory manipulations (autotroph-based food web) will be conducted within the main treatments of the Canopy Trimming Experiment. This experiment will employ small-scale mesocosms and removal of organisms to isolate the potential effects of food web components thought to influence ecosystem processes. Because of the intense maintenance requirements of these manipulations, they will be conducted for only two years.
