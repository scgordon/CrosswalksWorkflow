Among life history traits, seed dispersal mode is an important autecological characteristic that has the potential to influence various aspects of species interactions with the environment, yet its role in determining patterns of distribution and abundance on large geographic scales is not well understood. This study will examine the influence of seed dispersal mode in determining patterns of postglacial migration, northerly range extent and the location of modern range edge for an assemblage of six herbaceous species with differing seed dispersal modes in the deciduous forests of eastern North America. The primary research approach will involve a comparative phylogeographic analysis of congeneric or closely related forest herb taxa with differing seed dispersal modes. Genetic analysis of chloroplast DNA variation across species ranges will be used to reconstruct the history of population fragmentation during Pleistocene glaciations of North America and the subsequent expansion of populations during the Holocene. Comparative analyses of migration patterns and population genetic structure among plant taxa with differing seed dispersal modes will be used to assess the improtance of seed dispersal mode in determining rates and patterns of Holocene recolonization.</para><para>The project will involve a comparative phylogeographic study of six forest herb taxa: Actaea pachypoda, Cimicifuga racemosa, Jeffersonia diphylla, Podophyllum peltatum, Uvularia grandiflora and Polygonatum pubescens. Several of these forest herb taxa occur at the Coweeta LTER; these species would be the focus of sampling during my visit to the site. Phylogeographic analyses utilize variation in molecular markers to study geographic patterns of relatedness between populations. In plants, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is commonly used because it is often variable at the population level and is maternally inherited (i.e., via ovules); consequently, it can provide a direct measure of migration via seed dispersal. By screening for cpDNA loci that exhibit variation among plant specimens from across a species range, it is possible to develop a phylogeny which can be geographically referenced to infer the history of population fragmentation and expansion. For this study, leaf samples of approximately 2 x 2 inches would be collected from 5-20 individuals of each of the focal species at each of 30-40 population sites across the southeastern United States, Midwest and Northeast. One to three populations of each of the focal species occuring at Coweeta LTER would be identified in consultation with Coweeta LTER staff and sampled during a one to two day period in June of 2003. Leaf samples would be collected from 5 - 20 individuals in each of these populations. The sampling procedure should not substantially harm plants sampled; no plants would be collected in whole, dug up or otherwise disturbed or destroyed. The leaf samples from these populations would be transported to Cornell University with other leaf samples from the southeastern United States for processing and screening for cpDNA polymorphisms. The cpDNA haplotypes identified by this analysis and analysis of specimens from other regions of the eastern United States will be geographically referenced to examine patterns of cpDNA variation in relation to species range; specifically, the research will reconstruct patterns of Holocene migration for the selected focal species in eastern North America and infer locations of refugia and/or southern population centers during the glacial maximum. Comparative analysis of these data among related taxa with differing dispersal modes will evaluate the role of seed dispersal in driving rates and patterns of migration, and resultant range edge-range size dynamics.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1085_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>The location of plant populations to be sampled will be determined in consultation with Coweeta staff.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-04-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-01-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
