Tiles were collected every 5 days over a 40 day period, and variables such as inorganic dry mass, AFDM, chlorophyll a, and algal and invertebrate abundances were determined. Physical and chemical parameters of the streams were also assessed. The purpose of this research was to determine how top-down influences of macrobiota change along a land-use gradient.</para><para>To exclude macrobiota, we used an electric exclusion design developed by Pringle (Pringle and Blake 1994); this method allowed for exclusion of large organisms but minimized artifacts (e.g., decreased flows) associated with traditional enclosure/exclosure methods. Experiments were run for 40 days in an attempt to elucidate longer-term impacts. Unglazed ceramic tiles were tethered inside electric and control hoops, which were arrayed at each site in a paired design (10 hoops per site, 5 electric and 5 control). Electric and control hoops were paired to minimize between-hoop differences in water velocity, water depth, shear stress, and canopy cover. Beginning at day 15, one tile per hoop was collected every 5 days. Tiles were scraped and sampled for invertebrates, inorganics, AFDM, and algae according to standard methods. Observations of macrobiota visiting each hoop were made every five days, prior to tile collection. At the experiments end, each site was electroshocked to determine what macrobiota dominated the fauna.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>macrobiota</keyword><keyword>land use</keyword><keyword>electric exclusion</keyword><keyword>top-down</keyword><keyword>invertebrates</keyword><keyword>Campostoma</keyword><keyword>sedimentation</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary4014_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Beaverdam Creek, Sweeten Creek, Upper Davidson River</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1998-06-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1998-08-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
