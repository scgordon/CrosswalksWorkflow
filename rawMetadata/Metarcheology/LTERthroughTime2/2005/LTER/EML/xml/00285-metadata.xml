					<para>Each day starts at 12:00 MST. Flows (Q) for 1982-1985 were derived
						from stage records using the following formula: Q = 0.00172 * Stage ^ 2.808.
						Flows (Q) for 1986 were derived from stage records using the following 
						formulae: Q = 0.00075 * Stage ^ 2.649 (for stage &gt; 4.14) and Q = 0.00692 * 
						Stage ^ 1.087 (for stage LT or = 4.14). Flows (Q) for 1987-1995 were derived 
						from stage records using the following formula: Q = 0.022 * Stage ^ 2.6793. 
						Flows were initially calculated in cfs and later converted to m3/sec. Stage 
						was measured from the top of a metal rod in the left bank of the channel at 
						control section of 30 m downstream of culvert at base of Martinelli. Daily 
						flows were estimated by trapezoidal integration of 25 hourly flows. Data for 
						26-28 May 1990 were estimated because of a snow-clogged channel.
						Data for 6-10 May 1994 were estimated from occasional field observations
						and not a continuous logger record.
						The pressure transducer cell was reset about 6 cm lower in the channel on
						8 June 1995.</para>

						1 September 2010.
						Logged water levels should be corrected to stage values by:
						Stage (cm) = LVL(CR21x)* 6.761 - 4.372	(r2 =	0.989; N = 59)
						The apparently high flows of 23/05/10 17:40 MST are probably due to blocking 
						of the channel by snow and ice. They have little effect on the estimated total
						flow for the day.</para>
					<para>2011:
						Field measurements of water level (LVL) are taken by reference to the top of 
						rebar on the left bank of the channel (the other rebar, closer to the center 
						of the channel, is the support for the stilling well). Stage (S) is then 
						defined as S = 44.4 - LVL cm. Since the stilling well is installed and removed
						each season, the height of the pressure transducer below this reference level
						varies and needs to be recalibrated every season. For 2011, the calibration 
						record is available in file MAR-CAL.xls.
						CR21x record:  2011-final-mar.rpt
						Started	7/07/11 11:00 MST
						Ended	 	2/10/11 10:30 MST
						Data are comma-delimited and recorded in columns: Col 21 contains the average
						LVL for the 10 minute interval. Flows were less than 1.0 L/s at the end of
						this record.
						The record from July 7 to 14 is questionable because of disturbance and equipment
						failure. The best estimates of stage for this interval appear to be:
						Stage (cm) = LVL &#226;&#128;&#147; 4.1	to 11/7 05:30 MST then
						Stage (cm) = LVL + 11.7 to 14/7 06:50 MST.
						After 15/7/11 13:20, logged water levels should be corrected to stage values by
						Stage (cm) = LVL(CR21x)*11.094 &#226;&#128;&#147; 5.232 (r2 = 0.998; N= 40)</para>
					<para>2012:
						Field measurements of water level (LVL) are taken by reference to the top of 
						rebar on the left bank of the channel (the other rebar, closer to the center of the
						channel, is the support for the stilling well). Stage (S) is then defined as 
						S = 44.4 - WL cm. Since the stilling well is installed and removed each season, 
						the height of the pressure transducer below this reference level varies and needs
						to be recalibrated every season.
						The CR1000 stream flow records for 2012 are available in Mar-12.xls
						Started	15/05/12 13:00 MST
						Ended	 	22/08/12 12:20 MST
						The channel was dry after 9/08/12.
						Logged water levels (LVL) have been corrected to stage values by
						Stage (cm) = LVL*10.76 &#226;&#128;&#147; 4.96	 (r2 = 0.954; N = 48)</para>
