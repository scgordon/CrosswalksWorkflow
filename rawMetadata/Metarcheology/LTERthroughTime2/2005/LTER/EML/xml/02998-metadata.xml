Two sites are dominated (&gt; 80%) by sugar maple (SM1 and SM2) and two are dominated by yellow birch (YB1 and YB2). In the fall and winter of 1996, understory was removed from these plots, and equipment was installed. SM1 is a south-facing site which lies west of W6 at 648 m asl. SM2 is a south-facing site which lies northwest of W101 at 564 m asl. YB1 is a southeast-facing site which likes west of W101 at 472 m asl. YB2 is a north-facing site which lies near W7 at 640 m asl. Slope at SM1, SM2 and YB1 is moderate (about 20%), and slope is steeper (27%) at YB2.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>DATA DESCRIPTION</title><para><literalLayout>Dynamics of fine roots (&lt;1 mm diameter) were monitored using minirhizotrons. Four clear plastic minirhizotron tubes (5 cm diameter) were installed at a 45&#176; angle in each of the four reference plots during fall 1996 and spring 1997. Tubes were installed to depth of obstruction by rocks, which varied from site to site with a mean of 21 +/- 5 cm standard error. Styrofoam insulation was placed in each tube to minimize temperature differences between the tube environment and the bulk soil. Images were collected at 25-mm intervals along each tube approximately monthly during the snow-free season from November 1997 to September 1999. Winter conditions prevented measurements from late November until mid-April; thus, overwinter mortality and production are reflected in data from April, the first collection after snowmelt. On each date, about 40 images were collected from each tube along four axes filmed at about 45&#176; from vertical along the upper and lower surfaces of each tube.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Images were analyzed using RooTracker software. Each month, the location, length, diameter and appearance of all new roots growing within each frame were recorded. Changes in size and morphology of each root were tracked through successive intervals. A root was classified "dead" when it became very faint or discontinuous with indistinct edges, shriveled to a fraction of its previous width, or completely disappeared. Dead roots were subsequently tracked until disappearance, and apparently dead roots which later grew or appeared restored were returned to the live category. Roots which became obstructed from view by other roots, condensation, debris, or subtle shifts in MR tube position were classified "obscured" and watched for subsequent reappearance; those that did not reappear were not included in calculations of root mortality.</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>CALCULATIONS</title><para><literalLayout>From these data, fine root length density, production and mortality for each plot were calculated for each interval by pooling data from all four tubes within each plot. Root length density (mm cm-2) was calculated by summing live fine root length and dividing by total minirhizotron tube viewing area. Mean daily fine root production rate (mm cm-2 day-1) was calculated as new root length visible during an observation interval divided by total tube viewing area and the number of days since the previous filming. Because fine root mortality was highly dependent upon the amount of fine root length visible, we calculated a proportional daily fine root mortality rate (% day-1), as root length mortality divided by live root length in the previous interval, and divided by the number of days since the previous filming.</literalLayout></para></section></description><citation scope="document"><title>Soil freezing
