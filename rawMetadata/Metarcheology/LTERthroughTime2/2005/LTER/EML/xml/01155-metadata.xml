On 10 March 1993 data were added from daily  DP211 datapod files for the period from 30 August 1986 through 26 January  1993. These files had been processed on culter and quality checked by Mark Losleben in late 1992 and early 1993. See "Raw DP211 Datapod Files"  in  THE MANAGEMENT OF NWT LTER DATA ON CULTER and "Log of Modifications Made  to DP211 Datapod Files" for additional information. Lines, dates, and  missing value indicators were added for periods of missing data at this time.[RCI 10 March 1993] This file was put under sccs control on 30 March 1993. See the appropriate history file for additional log information.
