It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Eda</givenName><surName>Mel&#195;&#169;ndez-Colom</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Puerto Rico</organizationName><positionName>Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies (ITES)</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.O.

Due to variablity in flow conditions not all of the pools were sampled at each time point. 1-4 minnow traps, depending on pool size, were baited with Moist Meals cat food (chicken flavor) and placed in each pool late in the afternoon at approximately 3 week intervals. The reach was broken into two halves and the upper section trapped one day followed by the lower section on the next day. The traps were checked in the morning; all shrimp caught were identified to species. Carapace length and if the shrimp was gravid were recorded. Shrimp were returned to the pool they were caught in after all data was collected.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Fresh Water Shrimp Population Dynamics</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Karen</givenName><surName>Buzby</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>Spatial and temporal patterns of abundances for coexisting species: different intensities and frequencies of disturbances can alter spatial and temporal patterns of abundances for coexisting species. To determine if these different hydrologic regimes altered distributions of populations, we compared shrimp densities during different periods of time. There were significant differences in the relationships between locations of stream pools along an elevational gradient (300 to 470 m) and the abundances of two species of shrimp (Atya lanipes and Xiphocaris elongata) during the following three periods: pre-Hurricane Hugo (20 mo), post-Hurricane Hugo (50 mo), and low-flow (12 mo).  Mechanisms that likely cause different patterns of distribution (See Abstract) include avoidance of predators coupled with active preference by prey species for pool habitats with low frequency of washout by storm flows, and with sufficient storage of food resources (microbially conditioned leaf detritus).</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>LTER</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></ns0:eml>
