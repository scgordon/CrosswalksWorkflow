Biodiversity will serve as a surrogate for over-all site health, and thus the "sustainability" of a certain treatment type. Harvested sites that have biodiversity measures more similar to undisturbed sites will be considered sustainable harvest. Using the GOS Method, developed by the Carolina Vegetation Survey, the following types of sites were surveyed: undisturbed for at least 50 years, sites that were formally used for agriculture, but have naturally re-forested over 50 years ago and clear cuts, high intensity partial cuts and low intensity partial cuts over a range of ages since treatment. Using ordination and residual analysis, relative differences in treated stands can be quantified in relation to untreated stands. Thus, timber harvesting methods that result in comparably lower herbaceous diversity can be identified in this watershed. This data set will serve as a first step in what will ultimately become a sustainable management plan for timber harvest in the Little Tennessee Watershed.

(See Peet et al. 1998. A flexible, multipurpose method for recording vegetaion composition and structure. Castanea 63(3):262-274.) In this type of data collection, a 50 x 20 meter plot is located in the treated area. This area is divided into ten 10 x 10 meter modules. Four of these modules are intensive modules. The other six modules are reffered to a Residual Modules. In two corners of each intensive module nested plots of increasing sive (10 x 10 cm, 31 x 31 cm, 1 x 1 m and 3.1 x 3.1 m) are surveyed for plant species. A plant identified in the smallest plots is given a presence class of 5 and thus a plant found only in the entire 10 x 10 meter module is recorded as a presence of 1. In each plot of increasing size, only new species that were not found in the preceding plot are recorded. This procedure is repeated in the other 7 intensive corners in the plot. After each module is surveyed in this manner, each species found is given a number which corresponds to a Percentage Cover Class. This data is important to show the relative importance for a certain species, and because of the bias inherent in using this kind of data, should always be performed by the same person. In the residual modules, new species are identified that were not found in the intensive modules. Again, cover classes are assessed. In all 10 modules, all woody stems above DBH are identified, measured and placed in specific diameter classes (cm). Four soil samples (one from each intensive module) of about a 10 cm diameter, are taken from the A-horizon. If a B-horizon can be reached, one sample of that is taken. In addition, specific descriptions of each horizon are recorded. Descriptive base line data needs for each site include: slope (degrees), aspect (degrees), bearing of plot center line (degrees), Physiognomic class (Forest, woodland, etc), Dominant Leaf Type, Dominant Leaf Phenology, Hydrologic Regime, Drainage, Salinity, Topographic Position, Landform type, Mcnab Indices (position within landscape, plot microtopographic shape), Ground cover estimations (%) (bryophyte/lichens, decaying wood, bedrock/boulder, gravel/cobble, sand/soil, litter/om, water, and "others"), canopy height (m), Percent Cover by Strata (Herb, shrub, understory, canopy and emergent), any distubance notes, GPS coordinates, photographs (4 of the canopy and 4 from the plot center in each of the 4 cardinal directions), and any other notes that the researcher may find important for data analysis. Data must be collected in this manner as an integral part of the study relies on comparing the data collected from the harvested sites to undisturbed data collected both by the current researcher and past data collected by the Carolina Vegetation Survey. Model building and data analysis will begin with a large body of data taken by CVS in undisturbed areas. Residual analysis will come into play when the "disturbed" sites are incorporated into this model.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Sustainable forestry</keyword><keyword>forestry</keyword><keyword>sustainable forestry practices</keyword><keyword>herbaceous diversity</keyword><keyword>timber extraction</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1077_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Plots are located throughout the Little Tennessee watershed, Nanatahala National Forest, in rich coves or northern hardwood forests where various form of timber extraction have occurred over the past 60 years.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
