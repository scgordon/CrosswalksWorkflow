Over the past 120 years, the Nantahala N.F. has been shaped by a variety of harvesting techniques including individual tree selection, clearcutting, shelterwood, group selection, and two-age harvest. Broad scale timber extraction can drastically alter the structure and microclimatic conditions of forest ecosystems resulting in elevated ground and air temperatures, decreased soil and litter humidity levels, loss of leaf litter, and the gain or loss of coarse woody debris. Post extraction forest stand changes can have a direct effect on the abundance and diversity of plant and animal species that reside in the forest landscape. This study will focus on the response of plethadontid salamanders to various timber harvesting methods over time. Plethadontid salamanders were chosen for this study because their physiological attributes, life history characteristics and high sensitivity to habitat perturbations make them especially suited as indicators of forest biodiversity and health.</para><para>At each site, a point shall be designated as the plot center. From the plot center, a 50 x 50 meter plot shall be established following the study design employed by Petranka et al. (1994). To control for the confounding effects of forest edge, all plots shall be located a minimum of 15 m from uncut forest or in the case of control plots, 15 m from cut forest. A natural cover search method shall be used (turning all logs and rocks in the plot) during daylight hours to locate and record the relative abundance and species richness of salamanders for each plot. Additional information to be collected at each plot will include leaf litter depth, percent canopy closure (for two-aged and control plots), and a classification of coarse woody debris (amount, size and degree of decay). | There should be minimal disturbance to the study site due to the rolling of decayed logs. Steps will be taken to return all natural cover objects to their original location. No other disturbance is foreseen from this project.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Plethadon</keyword><keyword>Plethadontidae</keyword><keyword>salamanders</keyword><keyword>timber harvest</keyword><keyword>clearcutting</keyword><keyword>selective harvest</keyword><keyword>sustainability</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1076_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Watershed 28</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2002-07-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2002-08-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
