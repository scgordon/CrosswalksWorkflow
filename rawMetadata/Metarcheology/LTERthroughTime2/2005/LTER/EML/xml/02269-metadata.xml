The National Science Foundation requires that data from projects it funds are posted on the web two years after any data set has been organized and &#8220;cleaned&#8221;. The data from each census of the LFDP will be updated at intervals as each survey of the LFDP shows errors in the previous data collection. After posting on the web, researchers who are not part of the project are then welcome to use the data. Given the enormous amount of time, effort and resources required to manage the LFDP, obtain these data, and ensure data accuracy, LFDP Principal Investigators request that researchers intending to use this data comply with the requests below. Through complying with these requests we can ensure that the data are interpreted correctly, analyses are not repeated unnecessarily, beneficial collaboration between users is promoted and the Principle Investigators investment in this project is protected.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>LUQ</keyword><keyword>Luquillo</keyword><keyword>PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>ADEQUATE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><para><literalLayout>The scientists, the LEF-LTER Program, and the USDA International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) must receive adequate acknowledgement for the use of data by other scientists, and the LEF LTER program must receive two copies of any publication using that data.

It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Jill</givenName><surName>Thompson</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Puerto Rico</organizationName><positionName>Principal Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies (ITES)</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>Temporary address September 2004-September 2005</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>PO BOX 68</deliveryPoint><city>PETERSHAM</city><administrativeArea>MA</administrativeArea><postalCode>001366</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(787)764-0000</phone><phone phonetype="fax">(787)887-5974</phone><electronicMailAddress>jill@coqui.net</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

A tropical forest characteristically has few common species and many rare species, with conspecifics often widely distributed throughout the forest.  The potential for inter and intra-specific interactions are numerous, and it is difficult to determine which factors maintain species diversity or how rare species survive in the population.  Factors that we believe contribute to tropical forest structure and composition include the physical environment and past history of the forest, species-specific physiological requirements for light, nutrients and water necessary for growth, survival and reproduction, and pathogens and herbivores.  Despite the substantial amount of information available about these factors, we are still unable to accurately model the current composition of tropical forest or to predict its future response to human and natural disturbances.  The Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), previously known as the Hurricane Recovery Plot (Zimmerman et. al. 1994) and the Luquillo long-term ecological research grid (Soil Survey 1995), is a 16-ha forest plot (SW corner 18  20&#8217; N, 65  49&#8217; W) located near El Verde Field Station. The plot is 500 m N-S and 320 m E-W and is divided into 400 20 x 20 m quadrats, with each quadrat sub divided into 16 5 x 5 m sub-quadrats.  The field station and LFDP are in the Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico, approximately 35 km southeast of San Juan.  Information from the LFDP contributes to the efforts of the Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS, Smithsonian) network of large tropical forest plots in order to improve our understanding of tropical forest and to predict its future.  Large plots (typically 50 ha) are required to cover local environmental variation, include sufficient numbers of individuals of both the common and rare species, and to determine plant spatial relationships.  Population monitoring is required over many years to elucidate tree life histories, species interactions and population changes in order to determine the forest response to environmental changes and disturbance.  The LFDP is unique among the CTFS sites as it has a history of land use disturbance and also hurricane damage. These two disturbance types interact and influence the community dynamics and species composition in the LFDP.  The Northern area (approximately two thirds of the plot) was disturbed by tree felling and farming until 1934 when the land was purchased by United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. The Southern third was not farmed and only suffered relatively light disturbance from selective logging. Aerial photographs taken in 1936 show differences in canopy cover caused by the patterns of land use history.  Clear patterns in the distribution of some species reflect this land use history (Thompson et. al. in press).  The distribution of species as a result of the land use history interacts with hurricane disturbance, as those species colonizing the northern part of the LFDP are more susceptible to hurricane damage (Zimmerman et. al. 1994). Major hurricanes struck the forest area of the LFDP in 1928 and 1932 and after a 66 year period with relatively little hurricane damage, the forest was struck by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Georges in 1998, both hurricanes causing significant damage.  LFDP CENSUS HISTORY.  The LFDP was established in 1990 and the censuses are carried out in accordance with CTFS protocol (Condit 1998) with only minor variations.  The first assessment of stems &gt;= 10 cm D130  (diameter at breast height [DBH] of 130 cm from the ground) consisting of stems damaged by Hurricane Hugo (September 1989) was carried out from August 1990 to September 1991 (Everham 1996).  The first complete census of all stems &gt;=1 cm D130 lasted from August 1990 to September 1993.  This first census was divided iinto three surveys with the first survey (August 1990 to February 1992) comprising all free standing (excluding lianas) woody stems&gt;= 10 cm D130.  The second survey (overlapping the third survey) consisted of checks on a small number of quadrats in which a few large stems &gt;= 10 cm D130 were found that had been "missed" during the first survey.  The third survey of woody stems &gt;= 1 cm &lt;10 cm D130 was carried out between April 1992 and September 1993.  During Census 1 surveys 2 and 3 stems were found that were &gt;=10 cm D130 and, therefore, were most likely to have been present in the forest at the time of Census 1 survey 1.  In addition in Census 2 (November 1994 to October 1996), stems were found &gt;=3 cm D130 (&gt;=5 cm D130 for Cecropia schreberiana and Schefflera morototoni) which may have been missed in Census 1.   In order to include these "missed" stems in the appropriate census and survey we calculated what diameter the stem would have been at the time the quadrat in which it was located was initially assessed.  These "missed" stems were allocated to earlier censuses and census surveys based either upon the actual growth rate of that stem, if more than one measurement was available, or the median growthrate for that species.  The median growthrate was calculated for two size classes of stems &gt;=1, &lt;10 cm, or &gt;=10 to 30 cm D130.  Using the most appropriate growthrate the diameter of the "missed" stem was extrapolated back in time to estimate the stem diameter at the correct survey time in Census 1.  If the calculated diameter matched the size class for an earlier survey the stem was allocated to it with its estimated diameter.  Information for stems &gt;=10 cm D130 damaged during Hurricane Hugo was combined with data for stems &gt;=10 cm D130, in census 1 survey 1 together with "missed" stems recorded in later surveys to reconstruct the forest as it was at the time of Hurricane Hugo.  The reconstruction to represent the forest at the time of Hurricane Hugo did not include diameter extrapolations back to September 1989, but to the time at which the appropriate size class of stems were measured between August 1990 and September 1993. The palm Prestoea acuminata was allocated to earlier census surveys based upon the height of the point of measurement and additional observations.  Further details on the procedures for allocating these "missed" stems to the appropriate census surveys can be found in the descriptions in the relevant data files. The last corrections to the Census 1 this data were made in May 2001.  In all censuses individual stems of the specified size were tagged, identified and measured for D130.  On multiple stemmed plants, all stems were individually tagged and the group of stems representing an individual plant was recorded.  In the first and second census stems &gt;=10 cm D130 were mapped.  Following CTFS protocol we are conducting the censuses at 5 year intervals. The second census (November 1994 to October 1996) consisted of only one survey with all stems &gt;=1 cm D130 censused at the same time, although only stems &gt;=10 cm D130 were mapped.   The third census (funded by the Andrew Mellon Foundation) started in July 2000 and is expected to finish in April 2002.  In this third census, in addition to mapping stems &gt;=10 cm D130, we are also mapping the location of stems &gt;=1 cm D130.  :  R. DeLeon, J. Bithorn, M. Aponte, A.-L. M&#233;ndez, M. Estades, A.
