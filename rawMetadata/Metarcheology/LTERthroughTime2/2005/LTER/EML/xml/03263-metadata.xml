Six sites  characterized by relatively shallow snowpacks were sampled in 1993.   A total of 27 sites were sampled in 1994. Nine of the 1994 sites  were located in the naturally shallow snowfield sampled in 1993,  9 sites were located in a formerly shallow snowpack site where snow  depth was augmented by the construction of a 2.8-m high, 60-m long snowfence, and the 9 remaining sites were located in a naturally  deep snowpack. Concentrations of N2O and CO2 at the soil surface  were measured monthly from January until March, biweekly through  April, and weekly until snowmelt was complete. Elevated levels of  CO2 under the snowpack, suggesting microbial activity, were first  observed under the shallow snowpacks in early March of 1993. N2O  production under snow was first observed in April 1993, when soil  temperatures had warmed above -3 degrees C. In 1994 shallow  snowpack sites exhibited diminished and sporadic production of both  CO2 and N2O, apparently due to the inconsistent snow cover compared  to 1993. The snowfence sites exhibited increased CO2 and N2O fluxes  beginning in February 1994. Both CO2 and N2O fluxes from the  snowfence site were similar to those measured under the naturally  deep snowpack. These data suggest that the timing and depth of snow  cover during the alpine winter control microbial activity by  insulating soils from extreme air temperatures. To obtain a  regional perspective on subnivean trace gas fluxes, both CO2 and  N2O samples were determined at sites below treeline on Niwot Ridge and at Loch Vale in Rocky Mountain National Park.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>NWT</keyword><keyword>Niwot Ridge LTER Site</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>carbon</keyword><keyword>carbon dioxide</keyword><keyword>emissions</keyword><keyword>nitrous oxide</keyword><keyword>trace gases</keyword></keywordSet><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?subtgflx.pb</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1993-02-04</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1994-06-03</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription /><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-105.643</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-105.3753</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>40.0615</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>39.9932</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><para>The initial iteration of the documentation section of this file was generated from information provided by Paul Brooks and Mike Sannes on 25 August 1994.[RCI 25 August 1994] Additional  comments were provided by Paul Brooks on 6 September 1994 and these were incorporated into the comments section on 6  September 1994.[RCI 6 September 1994] The file was then put  under sccs control as "subnflux.pb" by Rick Ingersoll on 7  September 1994. References to Brooks (1995), Brooks et al. (1995), and Brooks et al. (1997) were added to the citation  section by Mike Hartman on 2 May 1996, 6 May 1996, and 8 October  1997 respectively, and the investigator contact information was  updated by Mike Hartman on 22 May 1996. On 15 October 1997 the  original "subnflux.pb" file was broken into two files so that  the raw source data (including the concentration and snow depth  data) could be made publically available while the calculated  flux data could remain proprietary. The raw source data file was  named subtgcnc.pb, the flux data file was named subtgflx.pb, and  both were placed under sccs control on 15 October 1997 while the  original subnflux.pb file was deleted.[MAH 15 October 1997]</para></description></maintenance><contact scope="document"><organizationName>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado</organizationName><positionName>Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>1560 30th Street, CB 450</deliveryPoint><city>Boulder</city><administrativeArea>CO</administrativeArea><postalCode>80309</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>lternwt@colorado.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>1560 30th Street, CB 450</deliveryPoint><city>Boulder</city><administrativeArea>CO</administrativeArea><postalCode>80309</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>lternwt@colorado.edu</electronicMailAddress></publisher><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=NWT,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>subtgflx.pb</entityName><physical scope="document"><objectName>subtgflx.pb</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>214</numHeaderLines><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat></physical><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>sample date (yymmdd)</attributeName><attributeLabel>sample date (yymmdd)</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>sample date (yymmdd)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><datetime><formatString>YYMMDD</formatString></datetime></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>absence of value</code><codeExplanation>not given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>location code</attributeName><attributeLabel>location code</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>location code</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>location code</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>absence of value</code><codeExplanation>not given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>treatment code</attributeName><attributeLabel>treatment code</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>treatment code</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>treatment code</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>none</code><codeExplanation>not given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>nitrous oxide flux (&#239;&#191;&#189;g N2O-N/m^2/day)</attributeName><attributeLabel>nitrous oxide flux (&#239;&#191;&#189;g N2O-N/m^2/day)</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>nitrous oxide flux (&#239;&#191;&#189;g N2O-N/m^2/day)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><customUnit>microgramsPerSquareMeterPerDay</customUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>absence of value</code><codeExplanation>not given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>carbon dioxide flux (&#239;&#191;&#189;g CO2-C/m^2/day)</attributeName><attributeLabel>carbon dioxide flux (&#239;&#191;&#189;g CO2-C/m^2/day)</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>carbon dioxide flux (&#239;&#191;&#189;g CO2-C/m^2/day)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><customUnit>microgramsPerSquareMeterPerDay</customUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>absence of value</code><codeExplanation>not given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute></attributeList></dataTable></dataset><additionalMetadata><unitList><unit id="microgramsPerSquareMeterPerDay" multiplerToSI="" name="microgramsPerSquareMeterPerDay" parentSI="kilogramsPerMeterSquaredPerSecond" unitType="arealMassDensityRate"><description>micrograms per square meter per day</description></unit></unitList></additionalMetadata></ns0:eml>
