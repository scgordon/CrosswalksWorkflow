Thus far, all soil data occurred in 1994 - ie. before the rhododendron removal. The summary C and N files are saved by date (year, month,and day). Within each file are data for Microbial carbon and nitrogen. The sample names (ex. C1-1, 0-5) indicate control plot, 1 meter distance from the stream, sample number 1, at the 0-5 cm soil depth, and so on. T would indicate treatment plot and 5-10 indicates

the 5-10 cm soil depth. Within each plot (C and T), we established three transects, 10 meters in length, at 1, 5, and 15 meter distances upslope from a stream. Along each

transect, 4 samples were collected and each sample consisted of two bulked soil

cores, separated by depth (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm). All sampling dates were in 1994, beginning in March. Sample dates were selected to correspond with seasonal changes and occurred March 25, June 16, August 16, November 1, and December 16. Microbial C data is listed as microgram C per gram dry weight soil, followed by an average of C (measured by distance from the stream) and standard deviation corresponding to that average. ND listed in the data set indicates that the sample needs to be reanalyzed or was missing.  The december data set needs more work, but I have included it anyway. | Microbial nitrogen is listed as microgram of total persulfate N per gram

dry weight soil. This is again followed by an average N value by distance from

the stream and depth of the soil and the corresponding standard deviation. Methods: Microbial Biomass carbon and nitrogen; Soils were cThe chloroform fumigation - extraction method was used to determine microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (Vance et al., 1987). All samples were extracted with 0.5 M K2SO4 for 30 minutes and all extracts were filtered through Whatman 42 filter paper and stored frozen until analyzed for microbial C and N. | Microbial carbon was determined using a Shimadzu TOC-500 Total C analyzer to directly analyze the extracts as described above. Data are reported as microgram total organic carbon (TOC) per gram dry weight soil. The correction factor used for carbon was kc = 0.33 (Smith and Paul, 1990). | Microbial nitrogen was determined by the total persulfate N (TPN) protocol of Cabrera and Beare, 1993. In this protocol, an aliquot of extract was first digested with a persulfate oxidizing reagent and then analyzed using an Alpkem RFA 300 colorimetric spectrophotometer. Data are reported as microgram TPN per gram dry weight soil. The correction factor for nitrogen was kn = 0.38 (Voroney and Paul, 1984).ollected as described above and then refrigerated until all samples were picked free of roots and recognizable plant material.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
