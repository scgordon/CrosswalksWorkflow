(2) Soils extracted using fresh soils generally yielded significantly lower exchangeable Ca , Mg, and K concentrations than soils which were dried and ground prior to extraction. Soil nutrients generally decreased with depth in the soil.  (3) Several soil properties varied predictably across the landscape and could be viewed in the context of a simple catena model. In the surface soils, exchangeable base cation concentrations and pH decreased along a gradient from ridge tops to riparian valleys, while soil organic matter, exchangeable Fe and acidity increased along this gradient. On the ridges, N,P, and K were positively correlated with soil organic matter; on slopes, N and P were positively correlated with organic matter, and Ca, Kg, and pH were negatively correlated with exchangeable Fe.  spatial patterns and methodological considerations.

It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Thomas</givenName><surName>Siccama</surName></individualName><organizationName>Yale University</organizationName><positionName>Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Forestry School</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>370 Prospect Street</deliveryPoint><city>New Haven</city><administrativeArea>CT</administrativeArea><postalCode>06512</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(203)432-5140()</phone><phone phonetype="fax">(203)432-5942</phone><electronicMailAddress>Thomas.Siccama@yale.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.
