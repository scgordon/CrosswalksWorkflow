Patterns of disturbance combined with observed social and economic changes in the region serve to forecast the likely future impact on terrestrial and aquatic resources. This is a unique opportunity to establish how the localized activities of individuals directed at the satisfaction of various kinds of needs and desires are guided by the knowledge, beliefs, and values shared with members of a social system and lead to particular outcomes in ecological processes. This overcomes the limitations associated with the driving forces commonly used to explain the human dimensions of global change: technology, socioeconomic organization, level of economic development, and culture. In so doing, it becomes possible to provide policy- makers with the time-and-place information needed for developing targeted, rather than generalized, instruments to respond to projected future conditions.</para><para>Mail survey of Chambers of Commerce from 65 counties in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. | Compilation of social and economic information for 65 counties in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia from National Census records. | Compiling GIS coverages of vegetation cover, elevation, potential trout-bearing

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
