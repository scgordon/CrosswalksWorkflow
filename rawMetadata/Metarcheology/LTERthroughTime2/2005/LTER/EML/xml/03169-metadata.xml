A means of gaining insight into this debate is by actually calculating rates of clay genesis, and identifying and quantifying clay mineral assemblages, in present-day terrestrial weathering environments where climate is known.  Source areas for terrigenous clay sediment may be placed along a continuum between two end-members;source areas are characterized by steep slopes where transport processes are more rapid than the weathering processes generating the clay, and transport-limited on gentle slopes whereby the maximum weathering rate exceeds the ability of transport processes to remove sediment. The latter pose the greatest concern for paleoclimatologists trying to use clay mineral assemblages from mudrocks and sediments to in erpret source area climate changes through geologic time. These concerns arise because clay detritus eroded from a transport-limited landscape may originate from paleosols, and not reflect the climatic conditions during erosion and transport of the clay to the depositional basin. A transport-limited environment may require several million years to develop a deep mature profile, and under such circumstances only long-term (1 or 2 Ma) paleoclimatic changes may be recorded in the clay mineral assemblages of the sedimentary deposits. | It is hypothesized that for the study area of the U.S. Forest Service Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CHL), that the mass of a given clay produced per unit volume of saprolite per time is climate dependent. Furthermore, the weathering profiles developed on the hillslopes of CHL will possess characteristic clay mineral assemblages that also reflect climate and hydrology. | Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the temporal resolution of clay mineral assemblages in paleoclimatic reconstructions, as CHL is characterized by relatively high rainfall (200 cm/year), substantial erosion rates (3.8 cm/1000 years), a thick (6 m) modern (100 Ka) regolith, and extensive hydrochemical data for use in mass balance determinations of clay genesis rates. CHL also permits the calculation of rates of clay genesis in saprolite developed under different climatic regimes (i.e., catchments located at significantly different elevations), but with other variables held constant (e.g., bedrock, aspect, vegetation, weathering duration, etc.). Most important is that weathering (and clay genesis) at CHL is occurring at the present time. | In terms of the weathering continuum outlined above, CHL provides intermediate data between the two end-members, and, through calculation of clay genesis rates, will permit determination of the resolution of the paleoclimatic record in deposits of clay minerals derived from source areas similar to CHL. This study will calculate rates of clay formation, and identify clay mineral assemblages, for weathering profiles (saprolite) which only vary by climate. Such data are essential if the clay mineral assemblages of ancient mudrocks and sediments are to permit accurate paleoclimatic interpretations.</para><para>Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory was chosen for the study because it maintains a continuous collection of data needed for the mass balance equations used for calculating clay genesis rates, including precipitation data (with solute chemistry), biomass data, stream discharge, and stream solute data. This study will utilize two pairs of watersheds. For a given pair, one watershed will be located at a significantly different elevation (and hence climate) than the other with all other variables being identical. Watershed (WS) 34 (low flushing rate and lower temperature) will be paired with WS 2, as both overlie Tallulah Falls Formation bedrock. WS 36 (high flushing rate and lower temperature) will be paired with WS 18, as both straddle the Shope Fork Fault, and hence overlie both Tallulah Falls Formation and Coweeta Group bedrock. This investigation will evaluate watersheds of all combination of temperature and flushing rate; that is, low temperature and low flushing rate (WS 34), higher temperature and higher flushing rate (WS 2), very low temperature and very high flushing rate (WS 36), and higher temperature and low flushing rate (WS 18). | Field sampling will be performed within the applicable watersheds on as complete weathering profiles as possible. Ideally, bedrock, a thick sequence of saprolite, and soil will all be present. Samples may be collected from outcrops, road cuts, and/or trail cuts, possibly also including use of a hand auger or soil probe. When vertical profiles are available, regolith may be sampled as frequently as every 10-20 cm through the section. Samples will be collected by driving a sampling tube (approximately 4 cm in diameter and 8 cm long) into the weathering profile. The bedrock underlying watersheds 2, 18, 34, and 36 is heterogeneous, and hence sampling will be performed spatially in such a manner that allows weathering profiles on similar (hopefully identical) bedrock to be compared. Lithologic variability will be evaluated using geologic maps and bedrock descriptions published by Robert Hatcher. | Based on the above discussion, a small quantity of vegetation at each sample location will need to be removed in order to gain access to the regolith and bedrock. Penetration into a vertical exposure will likely be no deeper than 30 cm, and will be performed one time only. Sampling performed by hand coring will only disrupt an area the diameter of the probe. The cored hole will be backfilled upon completion of sampling. Based on previous experience in the southern Appalachians, even vertical exposures of saprolite and soil revegetate quickly. No hazardous materials are involved during sampling, nor any special safety consideration, other than basic field safety.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>clay genesis</keyword><keyword>rates</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>watersheds</keyword><keyword>mass balance</keyword><keyword>geochemical kinetics</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1049_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Control watersheds 2, 18, 34, and 36 are desired for this study.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
