While examining the arthropod collections at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, we came across several series of Antrodiaetus unicolor that were collected from the Coweeta LTER site (please see specific localities/dates below). Interestingly, these spiders showed remarkable variation in size; furthermore, this size variation showed a strong correlation to the time of year. Large males were only collected in pitfall traps during September and October, whereas small males were only collected in November and December. This observation is intriguing. At a location several miles from Coweeta in extreme southwestern North Carolina, two highly divergent haplotypes of A. unicolor have been observed. Unfortunately, the specimens used for this part of the study were immature, so it is unknown whether these haplotypes belong to individuals with males of different sizes. We would also like to know if the size variation observed from that particular collecting season was an anomaly or whether there is a consistent and predictable pattern. It is also unknown whether females exhibit similar size variation. It is important that we collect these spiders at Coweeta because it appears that the area might be a zone of sympatry for two (or more) closely related species of Antrodiaetus. The results to be gained from this research will likely invite stimulating discussion about detecting species boundaries, historical biogeography, molecular evolution, speciation, character displacement, temporal isolation, and a host of other exciting biological phenomena. Locality Data: North Carolina, Macon County; Coweeta Hydrologic Station, Watersheds 2 and 7; pitfall traps; collected on 27-Sept, 13-Oct, 24-Nov, 19-Dec 1978 by Lee Reynolds.</para><para>The primary objective of this research is to collect live (or well-preserved) mygalomorph spiders for subsequent molecular work. For the first phase of obtaining specimens, spiders will be collected using pitfall traps (consisting of two 20 oz. plastic cups). Approximately 20 pitfall traps will be set-up per watershed (2, 14, 34), distributed randomly across stream banks or near steep slopes. Each pitfall trap will be provided with a roof to minimize flooding; this roof will be placed approximately two inches above the rim of the pitfall trap to exclude small vertebrates (e.g., salamanders, small rodents). A bright orange flag will accompany each pitfall trap to designate its location. Traps will be left open throughout the autumn and will be checked at least once every other weekend until the sampling session is finished in December. Ten or more traps per watershed will be live traps; these pitfalls will not include a preservative. Instead, the trap will be filled moderately with leaf litter to allow the spiders a place to hide. The remaining traps at each watershed will be kill traps; these pitfalls will be filled approximately one-third to one-half full of absolute ethanol. The second phase of obtaining specimens will involve actively seeking burrows. When burrows are located, they will be excavated using a small digging tool (approximately 10 cm long and 0.5 cm in diameter). All excavated soil will be replaced immediately upon removal of the spider. This procedure usually results in a minimal amount of disturbance. At the end of the sampling period (i.e., mid-December), all of the pitfall traps and accompanying materials will be removed.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>Easily accessible control plots</keyword><keyword>watersheds 2, 14, 34</keyword><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>along or near stream banks or steep slopes</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1088_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Watershed 1</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-09-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2003-12-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
