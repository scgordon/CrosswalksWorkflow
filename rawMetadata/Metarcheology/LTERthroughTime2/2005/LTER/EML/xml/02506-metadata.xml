    <section>
      <para>This data set includes precipitation chemisty from 20 funnel collectors on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). Variables measured include volume, NO3-N, NH4-N, SO4, Cl, Na, K, Ca, Mg, and PO4. The sample interval depends on the frequency of significant precipitations events. Field collection of precipitation chemistry samples occurred as soon after a significant precipitation event as possible (usually within a week after the event). In some cases collection of precipitation chemistry samples occurred more often than meteorlogical station samples (summer, fall), and sometimes less often (winter, spring). Precipitation chemistry samples were collected only when there was enough sample to allow for complete chemical analysis, (usually greater than 100mls). After 1995 all samples continued to be collected for volume but only an a partial set of the samples continued to be analyzed for inorganic nutrients.</para>

      <literalLayout>&#160; Additional Information on the Data Collection Period Data collected four times per year (usually January, April, July and October).Sampled one week per season, four seasons per year. Samples were generally collected monthly and usually on the last day of the month or on the first day of the subsequent month. The exceptions are 1) when there is little or no precipitation during that month in which case the collection is merely postponed until the following month or 2) the opposite extreme when there is heavy rain during the month so that it bcomes necessay to collect the samples before the collection bottles overflow. Where the Data were Collected A network of 20 funnel collectors and 2 wet/dry chemistry collectors was set out to monitor precipitation chemistry. There are 10 funnel collectors located on the west side and 10 on the east side of the Sevilleta NWR. Table 1. gives coordinates and description of the location of these collectors. In Table 1. P = ppt, E = east side, W = west side and the number = collector number. Figure 1. shows the individual collector site locations. A bulk chemistry funnel collector was placed at each of the 6 meteorlogical stations noted in the meteorlogical data archive files, with the other 14 distributed over the entire range of the Sevilleta. After 1995 only 6 of the funnels continued to be processed completely along with the wet and dry samples from each of the wet/dry collectors. In Table 1 an *denotes those samples continuing to be fully analyzed.  New funnels were added to the east side of the network beginning in 1998. The locations and installation dates of these funnels have now been added to the table. In addition PE4 was moved about 2 km west in conjunction with the installation of a new Met station and analyses were begun again in Jan 1999. Analyses were restarted at PE2 in Nov, 2001 as well. Some of the west side funnels have been totally discontinued. These include. PW3, PW5, PW6, PW9 and PW10  The location of all funnels can be seen at: http://sevilleta.unm.edu/research/local/nutrient/precip_chem/maps/newfunnels02.gif  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 1.

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Deep Well is located on McKenzie Flats and is site of the longest running SEV LTER met station, number 40, which has been active since 1988.&#160; In addition to studies of meteorological variables, core line-intercept vegetation transects and line-intercept transects from the 1995 and 2001 Deep Well fires are sampled here.&#160; The mini-rhizotron study, blue and black grama compositional comparison, blue and black grama patch dynamics investigation, and kangaroo rat population assessement are all ongoing here.&#160; Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is also the location of the warming and monsoon experiments, as well as portions of the line-intercept and vegetation removal studies.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the area of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed.&#160; While portions of this site were burned, the entirety was not.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the fire.Vegetation: The vegetation of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and blue grama (B. gracilis).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

      <geographicDescription>Location: The UNM Field Station and USFandWS Headquarters are the primary support facilities for all research conducted on the Sevilleta NWR. As such the area has also been important as a research site - especially as regards meteorology and monitoring of rodent populations for Hantavirus. While the breaks above and behind are characterized as black grama dominated desert grassland, the immediate area around the Field Station is best described as an ecotonal mixture of Plains-Mesa Sand Scrub and Great Basin Scrub vegetaion greatly influenced by honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and the drainages which bisect the area at regular intervals and support many one-seed Junipers (Juniperus monosperma). Dominant grasses include 4 species of dropseed (Sporobolis contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus and S. airoides) and indian rice grass (Oryzopsis hymenoides)</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral  tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR,  flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and  Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and  ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites.  Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although  rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site  because the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are  co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location Met Station 44.The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power 	lines.&#160;  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the 	met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.&#160;Vegetation: The Rio Salado Larrea site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), with honey mesquite, fourwing saltbush, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra), and broom snakeweed as co-occurring shrubs. Dominant grasses are black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), and fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum). Common forb species include desert holly (Acourtia nana), spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa spp.), blackfoot daisey (Melampodium leucanthum), twinleaf (Senna bauhinoides), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala). While individual creosote bushes tend to be larger, overall plant cover is less than at the creosote core site at Five Points, with more exposed embedded stones and gravel on the soil surface, creating a pavement-like appearance., </geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>How the Samples were Collected The 26.67cm (10.50in) polyethylene funnels are acid washed prior to collection with a 50 deionized water rinse. For each collection, a one gallon acid washed replacement bottle is prepared containing 1ml of a 1000ppm solution of phenyl mercuric acetate (PMA). The PMA functions as a preservative. The collected sample is routed through tygon tubing between the funnel and the bottle and forms a vapor trap to prevent evaporation of the sample. A tube running from the sample bottle to a 4oz. bottle containing water, provides a second vapor trap but allows the sample bottle to breathe during precipitation collection. Funnel Precipitation Collection Samples should be collected with care being taken to not contaminate the precipitation samples. Hands are a primary source of Na contamination so do not touch any surfaces that precipitation samples have or will come in contact with. Inspect funnel setup for damage of contamination. Look inside the funnel to see if it has been contaminated by bird droppings. If so, the funnel will have to be replaced with a clean one. Unscrew the lid of bottle; put lid from replacement bottle on the sample bottle. Put new bottle on stand and replace cap. With the two tubes coming out of the lids it is necessary to slightly twist these tubes counter clockwise before starting to twist the cap on so that the tubes do not end up too twisted after screwing on the lid. One can also simply screw the bottle on to the lid. Make sure that the seal is tight so that precipitation will not evaporate out of the bottle. Wet/dry collectors A wet/dry collector has been installed at Met40 (Deep Well). The Wet/Dry collector sample will be collected after significant storm events. The bulk chemistry collector at this site (PE3) should always be collected at the same time. As with all precipitation sample collection, care must be taken to not touch any surfaces that have or will come in contact with precipitation, therefore, all buckets should be handled by the sides, bottoms or handles. Care should also be taken to avoid stirring up dust in the vicinity of the collector which may bias the dry sample collection. The procedure for collecting the wet and dry portions of this collector, is as follows: Take two acid washed buckets with loosely fitting lids (that should always be transported in plastic garbage bags), out to the collector. Also, take 1000ml wide mouth bottle and 1000ml graduated cylinder. Place lid from one of the clean buckets on the dry collection bucket. Remove the tie-down strap and remove the dry bucket from the stand. Place the clean bucket in the holder and secure it with the tie-down. Actuate the moisture sensor so that the cover moves over the dry bucket (spit works). If cover does not move, check the battery voltage and connections and replace battery if necessary. Open 1000ml bottle, remove tie-down from wet bucket, remove bucket from holder, swirl sample in bucket well and transfer up to 1000ml of it to the wide mouth bottle. Place wet and dry buckets back in plastic garbage bags for return to laboratory. Laboratory Processing When bulk field samples arrive in the laboratory; individual samples are weighed, volumes are recorded (1gram = 1ml of water) and a 60ml subsample is poured off and stored for the wet chemistry analyses. Generally, samples with less than 100ml are not collected until the 100ml volume is exceeded. In some cases, bulk field samples containing less than 100ml, must be collected (as may be the case at the end of a quarter). For these samples, 100ml of deionized water is added to the original volume, so all analyses can be completed. Identified contaminated bulk samples, are noted as such, volumes are recorded, then the samples are often discarded. The primary precipitation chemical analyses are done using the 60ml subsample. In an attempt to isolate contaminated samples that were impossible to identify as such in the field; samples are initially analyzed for nitrate, ammonium, and major cations including; sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Data collected from these analyses, are then examined and compared with individual sample volumes. Ratios of specific cation concentrations within a sample are compared, then correlated with expected ratios. Samples with unusually high ratios, are determined to be contaminated. Contaminated samples are recorded as such and receive no further analyses. The remaining samples are then analyzed for chloride, and sulfate. 1st quarter: January 1 - March 30 2nd quarter: April 1 - June 30 3rd quarter: July 1 - September 30 4th quarter: October 1 - December 31 &#160; Specific analytical procedures The following text contains specific analytical descriptions and procedures used to analyze precipitation chemistry for the Sevilleta LTER.
