<abstract>
<para>
	Snow pits were excavated at various locations on Niwot Ridge
	and within the Green Lakes Valley. Temperature and snow density were 
	measured at various depths throughout the snow cover profiles in order
	to characterize the temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) of the
	snowpack throughout the year. Snow density was measured at 10-cm
	intervals using a 1000-ml cutter. Data on snow grain qualities were
	collected beginning in the 1994-95 snow season.</para>

					These data were manually entered using an EasyEntry form and
then processed on niwotlter, the NWT LTER workstation. </para><para>

Additional qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. air temperatures,
cloudiness and insolation, wind speed and direction, etc.) were
recorded on the original data collection forms but not included
in this file.</para><para>
It should be noted that snow profile data were used to characterize
snowpack temperatures and water equivalence over large areas.
As snow melted, profile locations were moved. Consequently, there
are instances where total snow depth for a given location code
increased from one date to the next, although no solid
precipitation had been recorded for the period. Large changes 
in total snow depth at a particular location code were often a 
function of minor relocation of the pit in conjunction with the 
rugged topography of the area. </para><para>
Location codes 001 through 088 refer to snow cover profile data for 
saddle grid stakes 1 through 80A, respectively. Location codes of 011 and 012, 
for example, would be used for snow profile data collected near grid 
stakes 10A and 11, respectively. Additional snow pit locations (and the 
respective location codes) were as follows: Saddle N15 site (081), 
Martinelli central upper slope - M10 site (082), Martinelli east upper 
slope - M19 site (083), south of Green Lake 4 inlet (084), north of Green 
Lake 4 inlet (085), Green Lake 4 outlet (086), Green Lake 5 (087), 50m 
south of creek on Navajo bench (088), Martinelli M2 (089), slightly 
different Navajo location than 088 (090), snowfence thermistor #3 east 
(t3e), N15 Saddle site control pit (NCO), N15 Saddle site 15nitrate 
addition pit (NO3), N15 Saddle site 15ammonium addition pit (NH4), 
Arikaree Glacier site (ark), 10 m west of subnivean lysimeter (sub), 
15 m south of subnivean lysimeter and 3 m south of Watershed fence (ssb),
Martinelli snow drift near road (MA1), Martinelli snow drift 5 m west of
