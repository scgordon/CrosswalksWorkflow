It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Randall W.</givenName><surName>Myster</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Central Oklahoma</organizationName><positionName>Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>100 North University Drive</deliveryPoint><city>Edmond</city><administrativeArea>OK</administrativeArea><postalCode>73074</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(787)764-0000(2867)</phone><phone phonetype="fax">(787)772-1481</phone><electronicMailAddress>RMyster@ucok.edu</electronicMailAddress><onlineUrl>http://luq.lternet.edu/myster/myster.htm</onlineUrl></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.
