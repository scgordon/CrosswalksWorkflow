  <abstract>
    <para>Aquatic macrophytes are sampled from a boat at stations located at depths from 1 to 4 meters at 0.5-m intervals along transects perpendicular to the lake shoreline of the four primary study lakes in the Madison area (Lakes Mendota, Monona, and Wingra, and Fish Lake) from June to August. A weighted, double-headed garden rake is cast off the front left, front right, rear left, and rear right of the boat and then dragged approximately 2 meters across the bottom by means of an attached line. For each rake cast, the total amount of filamentous algae and aquatic macrophyte species present is assigned a density rating from 0-5 based on the extent of coverage of the upper rake head. Determination of extent of coverage involves judgment of the surveyor as to the number of rake teeth and area of teeth covered. Ratings from the 4 rake casts at each station can be averaged to compute an overall density rating for the station In addition, the total plant mass and the total filamentous algae mass in each tow is measured. To the maximum extent possible, water is squeezed from the plants to minimize the amount of water present in the final weight. Weights are recorded in the boat using field scales. Weights from the 4 rake casts at each station can be averaged to compute overall average weights for plant mass and for filamentous algae mass at the station. A related data set (Macrophyte Rating --- Madison Lakes Area), contains rake ratings for individual macrophyte species. For each rake cast, filamentous algae and any aquatic macrophyte species present are assigned a density rating from 0-5 based on the extent of coverage of the upper rake head. Determination of extent of coverage involves judgment of the surveyor as to the number of rake teeth and area of teeth covered by each species. It is necessary to separate plants to assess individual species coverage. Ratings from the 4 rake casts at each station can be averaged to compute an overall density rating for each species found at the station. Sampling Frequency: annually during summer Number of sites: 4</para>

          <para>Macrophyte Sampling Schedule
	1.&#194;&#160; Macrophytes are sampled on Lakes Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, Wingra, and Fish Lake. Follow past years sampling order (Waubesa, Wingra, Fish, Monona, Mendota) and keep the dates as consistent to past years as possible (see list of dates). Working around the routine LTER sampling, schedule the macrophyte sampling well in advance in order to sign out a vehicle and boat when necessary.
	Macrophyte Sampling Method
	1.&#194;&#160; Using the site book and the depth measuring pole, move to the 1 meter depth mark and throw both anchors. It seems easiest to first throw the anchor opposite the direction the boat is moving and throw the second anchor in the opposite direction after the line from the first anchor is taught.
	2.&#194;&#160; From the Macrophyte Depth Table, find the distance to throw out the rake and hold that mark in one hand. Also determine the meter mark that the line should be drawn to. The table is calculated to determine the starting and ending meter marks to draw in the line to allow the rake to drag 2 meters on the lake bottom. The table assumes that the line is held 1meter above the water surface while dragging in the line.
	3.&#194;&#160; Throw the rake horizontally out the side of the boat stopping it at the correct meter mark on the line. Allow the rake to sink to the bottom. Draw in the line, holding it approximately 1 meter above the water surface. Stop drawing in the line at the correct meter mark.
	4.&#194;&#160; Pull the rake quickly out of the water. In order to retain the plants that are attached to the rake, it may be beneficial to rotate the rake 180 degrees once the rake handle is grabbed (so that the prongs that were dragged along the bottom are facing up). Then pivot the rake against the side of the boat and bring it into the boat.
	5.&#194;&#160; Before removing the plant material from the rake, drape the long strands over the rake and gently push the plant material down on the rake. Assign a rake rating (from 1 to 5) depending on how much the plant material covers the rake prongs. The rake prongs are painted in 20percent increments. If the plant material only covers the lowest 20percent of the rake prongs, assign the rake rating a 1. If the plant material covers between 20percent and 40percent of the rake prongs, the rake rating is a 2, and so on (see page on rating description).
	6.&#194;&#160; If a significant amount of dirt has been brought up with the plants (i.e. the weight of the dirt will add significantly to the total weight), wash the plants. Depending on the volume of the plants, wash them either by keeping them in your hands and dunking them in the lake or by putting them in the white bucket with the drain holes.
	7.&#194;&#160; Separate the filamentous algae from the rest of the plant material. Separate and identify the individual plant species, throwing out any dead plant material. Give the filamentous algae and each plant species a rake rating (note that it is often necessary to visualize how much space each species would take up on the rake prongs rather than actually placing each species onto the rake).
	If a plant species can not be identified take a sample back to the lab by putting it in a ziplock bag with a small amount of water and temporarily storing it in a cooler. Temporarily assign each unknown species with a common symbol or name on the data sheet (to be changed to the correct species name when identified). Stan Nichols at the WGNHS can be used as a resource (263-7389).
	8.&#194;&#160; Combine all of the plant species, keeping the filamentous algae separate, and squeeze out as much water as possible (it may be necessary to divide up the plant material into portions to effectively squeeze out the water). Weigh the plant material (minus the filamentous algae) and record the total weight. Weigh the filamentous algae and record the weight.
	9.&#194;&#160; Repeat the above steps until 4 rake tosses have been thrown. Normally 2 rake tosses are thrown out each side of the boat to an area where the water depth is known to be at the desired depth.
	10. Move to the next half-meter depth. Macrophytes are collected at each half-meter water depth from 1 meter to 4 meters. In the case of Lake Wingra, look at past years data to determine the deepest sampling depth for each transect (often 3 meters). In areas of steep drop-offs, it can be difficult to anchor the boat at the proper depth and it may be necessary to drop the anchor upwind and drift to the desired depth.

    <abstract>
      <para>North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research studies the ecology of lakes as one of a network of sites established by the National Science Foundation. We are interested in how biophysical setting, climate, and changing land use and cover interact to shape lake characteristics and dynamics over time (past, present, future).
	Our primary study sites include a set of seven northern Wisconsin and four southern Wisconsin lakes and their surrounding landscapes. The project, which started in 1981, is administered by the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Perception of Long-Term Change: How and why have the lake districts changed, and how will they change in the future?
	Climatic Forcing of Change: What are the major ecological and social responses of lake districts to climate change?
	Interacting Drivers, Scales of Space and Time, and Regional Change: How do multiple interacting drivers affect regional change in lake districts at multiple scales?
	Ecosystem Services: Past, Present and Future: What are the magnitudes, interactions and potential future flows of ecosystem services in lake districts?
