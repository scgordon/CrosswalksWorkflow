On average (n=30), 79% of Bisley organic matter was composed of coarse woody debris. Of the remaining 21% organic matter pool, approximately 2% was from leaves, 9% was from fruit, 9% was from miscellaneous matter, and 1% was from wood matter with diameters &amp;lt; 2.5 cm. In comparison, 57% (n=30) of Icacos organic matter was composed of coarse woody debris. Of the remaining 43% organic matter pool, approximately 0% was from fruit, 16% was from leaves, 10% was from miscellaneous matter, and 18% was from wood matter with diameters &amp;lt; 2.5 cm. The data suggest a less recalcitrant organic matter pool in the Icacos environment and higher rates of turnover than in the Bisley environment. It was also apparent that woody matter (&amp;lt; 2.5 cm diameter) deposition was a significant source of OM inputs in the Icacos plots.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>SOIL: Nutrient availability</keyword><keyword>Carbon</keyword><keyword>Coarse Woody Debris</keyword><keyword>Litter</keyword><keyword>Nitrogen</keyword><keyword>Nutrients</keyword><keyword>Organic Matter</keyword><keyword>Pools</keyword><keyword>Puerto Rico</keyword><keyword>BISLEY WATERSHEDS</keyword><keyword>CARBON</keyword><keyword>COLORADO</keyword><keyword>DECOMPOSITION</keyword><keyword>NITROGEN</keyword><keyword>OTHER PLOTS</keyword><keyword>Q ICACOS</keyword><keyword>TABONUCO</keyword><keyword>Organic Matter Accumulation</keyword><keyword>Environmental monitoring</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>ADEQUATE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><para><literalLayout>The scientists, the LEF-LTER Program, and the                                     USDA International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) must                                     receive adequate acknowledgement for the use of data by other                                     scientists, and the LEF LTER program must receive two copies of                                     any publication using that data.

It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>William H.</givenName><surName>McDowell</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of New Hamshire</organizationName><positionName>Principal Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Natural Resources</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>215 James Hall</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>56 College Rd</deliveryPoint><city>Durham</city><administrativeArea>NH</administrativeArea><postalCode>03824</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">787-749-4346(279)</phone><phone phonetype="fax">787-749-4462</phone><electronicMailAddress>bill.mcdowell@unh.edu</electronicMailAddress><onlineUrl>http://www.unh.edu/natural-resources/fac-bmcdowell.html</onlineUrl></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

Transects were spaced 4 m apart in each plot. At each intersect of the 1 cm wide measuring tape, organic matter debris &amp;gt; 2.5 cm diameter was recorded. Mass values from CWD were calculated using a mass density of .661 g cm3. Litter data was collected using a 0.16 m2 sampling square from five random locations in each of the plots (n=30). Litter was separated into categories of fruit, leaves, miscellaneous material and woody material &amp;lt; 2.5 cm diameter, then dried and weighed.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Soil Carbon and Nutrients in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF)</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>William H.</givenName><surName>McDowell</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>Nitrogen is being applied at a rate of 50 kg ha-1 y-1 to 20x20 m plots in the Bisley Experimental Watersheds and the Rio Icacos basin. This is a long term experiment designed to test current paradigms of N saturation in tropical forests. Coarse woody debris transect measurements are conducted once every two years in the study plots to monitor above ground organic matter pools of debris &amp;gt; 2.5 cm diameter. Forest floor litter composition is also quantified and classified as fruits, leaves, miscellaneous and wood (&amp;lt; 2.5 cm). We expect to see decreases in forest floor litter and coarse woody debris due to increased mineralization rates.</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>LTER</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></ns0:eml>
