Data have only been read from the hygrothermograph charts for three periods: January 1966 - April 1966, June 1967 - Sept. 1967, and May 1971 - April 1973. Beginning in 1981, a humidity sensor has operated as part of the automatic weather station at Headquarters.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>SAMPLING DESIGN</title><para><literalLayout>The hygrothermographs at Stations HQ, 1, 6, 14, 23 and INT record relative humidity by sensing the expansion and contraction of a set of horsehairs. The accuracy of their calibration and frequency of maintenance has varied considerably over the years. For a time in the early 1960s, they were not maintained at all. Beginning around 1965 they were calibrated occasionally (less than once a year) by operating in a chamber with saturated salt solutions. Since the 1970s, maintenance and salt calibration has been conducted annually, normally in the spring. Minimum relative humidity at the time of maximum daily temperature was converted to vapor pressure. Because vapor pressure varies little throughout a day and among locations, data from all available hygrothermographs were averaged in order to reduce error. For 1971 - 1973, averaging gave triple weighting to HQ and double weighting to Station 1 to reflect the relative quality of their calibrations.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Beginning in 1981, a humidity sensor has been operated as part of the automatic weather station at Headquarters. This was originally a Brady Array. Brady Array values were corrected by calibration with an Assmann psychrometer. When the weather station blew over on August 1, 1983, this sensor was destroyed and data collection stopped. On April 26, 1985 a Lambda temperature-humidity probe was installed. The humidity sensor has been replaced about annually since then; however, missing data still occur for a variety of reasons. The manufacturer\'s calibration is used and is checked occasionally with an Assmann psychrometer.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>For missing data since 1986, estimates have been made by taking the average vapor pressure calculated from the HQ and Station 1 hygrothermographs. Vp is calculated using the minimum humidity and maximum temperature for the date.</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep></methods><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=HBR,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>vp</entityName><entityDescription>Vapor pressure data at Hubbard Brook lter</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>vp.txt</objectName><characterEncoding>ASCII</characterEncoding><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n\r</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://www.hubbardbrook.org/data/data_policy.php?firstname=metacat&amp;lastname=user&amp;affiliation=Other&amp;view=1&amp;accept=1&amp;comments=none&amp;phone=6035551212&amp;email=none@loopback.com&amp;target=vp.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><additionalInfo><section><para><literalLayout>The data is physically located at the USDA Forest Service, Durham, NH and was last updated on March 25, 2002.</literalLayout></para></section></additionalInfo><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>DATE</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Sample date</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><datetime><formatString>YYYYMMDD</formatString><dateTimePrecision>1 day</dateTimePrecision><dateTimeDomain><bounds><minimum exclusive="false">19660101</minimum></bounds></dateTimeDomain></datetime></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>VP</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Vapor pressure</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>kilopascal</standardUnit></unit><precision>.01</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>-99.00</code><codeExplanation>Data missing or not taken</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>FLAG</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Flag</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><enumeratedDomain enforced="yes"><codeDefinition><code>e</code><definition>Estimated</definition></codeDefinition><codeDefinition><code>-99</code><definition>No flag present</definition></codeDefinition></enumeratedDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList></dataTable></dataset></ns0:eml>
