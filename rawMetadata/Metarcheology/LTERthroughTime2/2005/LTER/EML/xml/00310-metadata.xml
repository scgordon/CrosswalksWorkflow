<abstract>
<para>
	A snowfence was built in 1993 on the Niwot Ridge Saddle 
	grid to determine the effects of changes in snowpack on a number of variables,
	one of which was soil temperature. The study area was 60m x 125m. Soil 
	temperatures were measured at two depths (0 and 15 cm) at each of 13 locations 
	within the snowfence experiment area. Soil temperatures were measured at the 
	same depths at each of 6 control locations outside of but near the snowfence 
	experiment area. These measurements were made weekly to biweekly using fixed 
	thermistors and data loggers. Sampling locations were each given a unique 
	point identification number in order that these data could be incorporated 
	into the Saddle GIS. The snowfence was oriented in a north/south direction 
	and was 60m long. Each of the point identification numbers had a coordinate 
	within the experiment area. The first number of the coordinate was the 
	distance in m from the snowfence in an east/west direction, negative numbers 
	being west of the snowfence and positive numbers being east of the fence.
	The second number in the coordinate was the distance in m from the
	southern terminus of the snowfence in a northerly direction.
	The point identification numbers and coordinates were: 203 (-40,30), 
	217 (-30,30), 231 (-20,30), 245 (-10,30), 252 (-5,30), 259 (5,30), 
	266 (10,30), 281 (20,30), 295 (30,30), 309 (40,30), 323 (50,30), 
	337 (60,30). Controls were located outside of the snowfence experiment 
	area: 113 (approximately 10 m south of the -30,0 coordinate) in the 
	Acomastylidetum rossii vegetation association, 114 (approximately 11 m 
	south of the -25,0 coordinate) in the Acomastylidetum rossii vegetation
	association, 115 (approximately 8 m south of the 55,0 coordinate) in the 
	Kobresietum myosuroidis vegetation association, 116 (approximately 5 m north 
	of the 50,60 coordinate) in the Kobresietum myosuroidis vegetation 
	association, 117 (approximately 3 m north of the -23,60 coordinate) in 
	the Rhodiolo integrifoliae vegetation association, 118 (approximately 5 m 
	north of the -21,60 coordinate) in the Rhodiolo integrifoliae vegetation 
	association.</para>

	<para>The documentation for this file was created by Susan Kindig in early 
		May of 1993, with additional information being supplied by Rick
		Ingersoll and Brad Lewis. Data for 23 October 1992 through 7 May
		1993 were added to the data section at this time and the file was
		placed under sccs control.[SEK 7 May 1993] Data for 29 May 1993
		were appended on 2 June 1993.[RCI 2 June 1993] Data for 3 June
		1993 were appended on 4 June 1993.[RCI 4 June 1993] All data beginning
		23 October 1992 were double-entered using EasyEntry programs
		(see "The Management of NWT LTER Data on the PC") and then processed
		on a Sun SPARC 2 (see "The Management of NWT LTER Data on culter").
		[RCI 14 June 1993] Data for 22 June 1993 were appended to the data
		section on 29 June 1993.[RCI 29 June 1993] Data for 2 and 19 July 
		1993 were appended to the data section on 23 July 1993.[RCI 23 July
		1993] Data for 30 July 1993 were appended to the data section on 
		27 August 1993.[RCI 27 August 1993] Data for 11 December 1993 were
		appended to the data section on 14 December 1993.[RCI 14 December
		1993] Data for 30 December 1993 were appended to the data section
		on 7 January 1994.[RCI 7 January 1994] Data for 15 January 1994
		were appended to the data section on 28 January 1994.[RCI 28
		January 1994] Data for 4 February were appended to the data 
		section on 8 February 1994.[RCI 8 February 1994] Data for 26 February
		and 17 March 1994 were appended to the data section on 5 April 1994.
		[RCI 5 April 1994] Data for 18 April 1994 were appended to the data
		section on 29 April 1994.[RCI 29 April 1994] Data for 9 April 1994
		were inserted into the data section on 18 May 1994.[RCI 18 May 1994]
		Data for 2 June 1994 were appended to the data section on 7 June
		1994.[RCI 7 June 1994] Data for 8 July 1994 were appended to the 
		data section on 13 July 1994.[RCI 13 July 1994] Data for 1 July 1994
		were inserted in and data for 15, 22, 29 July, and 5 August 1994 were
		appended to the data section on 11 August 1994.[RCI 11 August 1994]
		Data for 12 August 1994 were appended to the data section on 17
		August 1994.[RCI 17 August 1994] The locations of the point 
		identification codes 117 and 118 were transposed as originally
		provided. This error was pointed out by Brad Lewis on 24 August 1994
		and the location codes in the comments section were corrected on that
		date.[RCI 24 August 1994] Data for 25 August 1994 were appended to 
		the data section on 26 August 1994.[RCI 26 August 1994] New 
		connections were added to the leads for the probes at point 
		identification codes 113 (C1), 114 (C2), and 259 (L1)on or prior to 
		7 May 1993. The color coding for these connectors was inadvertently 
		reversed so that the leads for the 0- and 15-cm probes appeared to be 
		for the 15- and 0-cm probes, respectively. The readings for those 
		probes from 7 May 1993 through 25 August 1994 were, in most cases, not 
		corrected by field or data entry personnel because they were unaware of 
		the switch. In late August 1994, in response to the anomalous readings
		for these probes in the summer of 1994, Brad Lewis dug up the probes
		and verified the switch. Brad then consulted the original hard-copy
		data sheets in conjunction with the data in this file and determined 
		the cases where the data needed to be corrected and those corrections 
		were made in the EasyEntry files, which were reprocessed. During this
		procedure, Brad noticed that the data for C5 (117) and C6 (118) had
		been switched for the 8 July 1994 data and these were corrected at
		this time as well. The 0- and 15-cm data transposition problems were
		corrected for 7 May 1993, 29 May 1993, 3 June 1993, 22 June 1993,
		2 July 1993, 19 July 1993, 30 July 1993, 11 December 1993, 30 December
		1993, 15 January 1994, 4 February 1994, 26 February 1994, 17 March
		1994, 9 April 1994, 18 April 1994, 2 June 1994, and 8 July 1994 data.
		The erroneous data were deleted and the corrected data were imported
		on 29 August 1994.[RCI 29 August 1994] Data for 14 May 1994 were 
		inserted into the data section on 1 September 1994.[RCI 1 September
		1994] Data for 11 and 17 July 1995 were appended to the data section
		on 31 July 1995.[RCI 31 July 1995] Data for 31 July 1995 were appended
		to the data section on 21 August 1995.[MAH 21 August 1995] Data for
		22 August 1995 were appended to the data section on 1 September
		1995.[MAH 1 September 1995] Data for 7 and 14 September 1995 and 
		01 October 1995 were appended to the data section on 20 October 
		1995.[MAH 20 October 1995] The references to Walker et al. (1994)
		and Brooks et al. (1995) were added to the citations section on 2 
		May 1996.[MAH 2 May 1996] The timing section was updated to indicate
		that manual records were last taken on October 1, 1995. URL locations
		for related data were updated at that time as well.[MAH 27 September 2000] The title, keywords, comments, cols, and data format were edited.
