hyporheic samplers. Hyporheic samplers consisted of a 1/8 inch   
O.D. stainless steel (S.S.) tube housed in a 3/4 inch CPVC pipe.    
At the lower end of the CPVC a rubber stopper was inserted with   
the S.S tube protruding ten centimeters.  A coupler was then used   
to attach a length of well screen to protect the S.S. tube.    
Samplers were inserted into the stream bed by forcing a pry bar   
into the stream bed  to a depth of the maximum depth allowed,   
typically 30-60 centimeters.  The sampler was then worked down   
into the hole and the pry bar removed, allowing the hole to cave   
in onto the sampler.  The length of the sampler, still above the   
substrate, was measured and subtracted from the total length to   
find the depth of the sampler in the substrate (Z).  Samplers   
were allowed to settle before measurements for the VHG were made.    
To make an accurate measurement of the difference in water depth   
inside and outside of the sampler a hydraulic potentiomanometer   
was built.  To eliminate a venturi effect on the instream tube   
the manometer was mounted on a PVC tube which acted as both a   
stilling well and a handy manometer stand.  The scale on the   
potentiomanometer had zero centimeters on the bottom.  Water   
height inside of the tube connected to the stream channel was   
recorded as L1, height of water from the sampler was recorded as   
L2.  The VHG was calculated as (L2-L1)/Z.  Negative values   
represent downwelling zones while positive values represent   
upwelling zones.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Notes: The variable, D/D for Distance on river is
