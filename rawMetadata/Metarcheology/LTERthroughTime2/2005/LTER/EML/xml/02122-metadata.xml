It has a warm                                 and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and                                 forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and                                 animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance.                                 Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the                                 forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the                                 significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested                                 ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the                                 response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years                                 after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments                                 which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Frederick</givenName><surName>Scatena</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Pennsylvania</organizationName><positionName>Principal Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Earth and Environmental Science</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>240 South 33rd Street</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>156 Hayden Hall</deliveryPoint><city>Philadelphia</city><administrativeArea>PA</administrativeArea><postalCode>19104-6316</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(215)898-6907(5724)</phone><phone phonetype="fax">(787)766-6302</phone><electronicMailAddress>fns@sas.upenn.edu</electronicMailAddress><onlineUrl>http://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/</onlineUrl></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

After Hurricane Georges on September 21, 1998, 2 more sites were added and samples were collected weekly for the following 10 weeks. In January 1999 monthly sampling was resumed. 

On each date 9 samples were collected at each site in the wide, deeper sections of the river, and 3 samples were collected from sites that were shallow and narrow. In the wide sections of river, 3 samples each were collected from the right, center, and left of the river. Each sample is represented by the scrapings of a known area of one rock (16 or 32cm2) using a template, a razorblade, a toothbrush, and deionized water to rinse the sample into a labeled bottle. Samples were collected from the same depth on each date (45 cm deep on the left and right sides of the river and 80 cm deep from the center of the river). In the shallower sections of the river samples were collected from approximately 10 cm depth.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Diatom Population Dynamics</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Frederick</givenName><surName>Scatena</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>Monthly collections of benthic diatoms are made at four sites in the Rio Mameyes of northeastern Puerto Rico. The sites range from an unpolluted closed canopy headwater stream within the National Forest, to a small, highly polluted coastal plain tributary that drains a golf course and surrounding suburban development. Diatoms are collected by cleaning a standardized area of randomly selected rocks from each site. The identification of the composition and abundance of diatoms in each site will be used to identify species and communities that reflect water quality and community response to floods, low flows, and water pollution.</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>IITF</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access></dataset></ns0:eml>
