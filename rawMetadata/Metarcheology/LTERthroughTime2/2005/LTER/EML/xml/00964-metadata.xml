lengths of 1/8 in. stainless steel (SS) tubing taped along 6 ft lengths of 1/2 
in. rebar.  The bottom end of the SS was open but covered with several layers 
of PVC window screen to prevent clogging.  The top end of the SS was attached 
to a 1/8 in. Swagelok to a 1/8 in. female NPT fitting.  This, in turn, was 
attached to a 1/8 in. male NPT to 1/8 in. I.D. plastic hose barb.  A two-inch 
length of 1/8 in. I.D. X 1/16 in. wall Tygon tubing attached tightly to the 
plastic hose barb fitting.  The sampling port, a three-way Pharmaseal 
stopcock, was inserted into the end of the plastic tubing.  This assembly 
ensured an air-tight sampling port.  Samplers were inserted into the streambed 
by initially forcing a steel pry bar into the cobbles to the deepest depth 
allowed, usually 30-60 cm.  The pry bar was carefully removed, and immediately 
replaced with the sampler.  The samplers were allowed to settle for two weeks 
prior to sampling. Wells were sampled with 60 cc B.D. syringes.  Initially  
purging each sampler was purged by withdrawing 10-20 ml of water slowly from 
the well.  This water was discarded and 60 ml of fresh water was withdrawn and 
immediately filtered with disposable 0.45 um, 25 mm diameter syringe filters 
into acid-washed 125 ml polypropylene bottles.  The filter was rinsed with 10 
ml of sample prior to collection of sample.  If the well water contained 
excessive sediment, the sample was allowed to settle in the syringe for 1 to 2 
minutes.  Filtered samples were refrigerated at Toolik Camp until nutrient 
analysis could be completed on the autoanalyzer.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Notes: These data should not be released to any party

Some data are unavailable at this time.  There was a problem with the file
transfer between the Technicon Autoanalyzer and the spreadsheet.  Sample dates
and locations were scrambled and can not deciphered.   The data reported here
are correct.
