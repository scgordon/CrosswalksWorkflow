Hydrology has been monitored since 1963, and stream water chemistry has been monitored since 1963. The watershed is forested by typical northern hardwood species (sugar maple, beech and yellow birch) on the lower 90 % of its area and by a montane boreal transition forest of red spruce, balsam fir and white birch on the highest 10%. Surveying techniques were used in 1965 to install a grid system of 208 grid cells, each 25 x 25 m square. These grid units serve as the coordinate system for sample plot selection. For more spatial information please visit the following links: http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/maps/w6_zones.htm and http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/w6_grid_elevations.htm.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Sampling was initiated in 1969-1970, repeated in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1982 and at 5 year intervals after that. These data were collected in the summer of 1976.
Repeated sampling at 5 year intervals is anticipated to continue.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>SAMPLING DESIGN</title><para><literalLayout>Each row of the Watershed 6 grid system of 25 x 25 m cells was considered a stratified sampling set and one or more cells was randomly chosen from these lines as cells to be sampled. Some rows are short, with only 1 to 4 cells, and others are longer, up to 10 cells across. The longer rows may have 2 or 3 cells sampled. The short rows may not have any cells sampled. The location of the sampling plot within each cell was selected by an x-y random number system and the location determined by pacing in to the selected coordinates from the corner of the 25 x 25 m cell. 59 of the 208 cells were sampled in 1976.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>FIELD COLLECTION PROCEDURES</title><para><literalLayout>Once a sampling point was located by pacing, a 12" x 12" plywood board with a 15 x 15 cm square hole was placed on the forest floor and 4 nails were placed through pre-drilled holes, one on each corner. This served to hold the template in place on the forest floor. A keyhole saw was used to cut around the edge of the 15 x15 cm hole in the board. The forest floor within the hole was isolated and removed down to the mineral soil. The contents of the hole were then placed in total in a plastic bag for return to the laboratory. (Note that in some years the forest floor was divided into sub layers --Oi, Oe, Oa or combinations of these. In 1976 the whole of the forest floor was collected undivided).</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>This method made it difficult to see what was being removed, so it was modified in subsequent years. After 1976, a 15 x 15 cm wooden template was secured to the forest floor and a keyhole saw was used to cut around the outside of the template. The surrounding forest floor material was then scraped back from the block leaving it as a pedestal so that the horizons were easier to distinguish before removal.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>NOTES</title><para><literalLayout>The primary objectives of the forest floor samplings in 1976-1978 were 1) the determination of the amount of lead(Pb) in the forest floor, 2) monitoring the total mass of the forest floor over time and 3) development of a field collection methodology which was efficient and easily implemented. It was determined that separation of the forest floor at least into Oie and Oa, would have been better than no separation whatsoever, so this procedure was implemented from 1987 onwards. It was also determined that air drying the Oa would have been preferable to oven drying. Air drying makes possible the determination of exchangeable nutrients, whereas oven drying alters the cation exchange complex. Air drying of the Oa was implemented from 1992 onwards.</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>LABORATORY PROCEDURES</title><para><literalLayout>The forest floor mass was oven dried at 80 oC to a constant weight, then ground in a Wiley mill to pass a 2 mm screen. Material too big or too tough (big sticks, roots, and rocks) to be put in the Wiley mill was removed. Samples of the ground forest floor were put in 4 oz. glass jars for long term preservation in the Hubbard Brook archives.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>For determination of organic content and chemical analysis, a 2.0 g sample of the oven dry ground material was placed in a pre-weighed crucible and ashed overnight at 450 oC. The ashed material was cooled and weighed. The ash was eluted with 10 ml of 6N HNO3 and heated for a few minutes (to a simmer) on a hot plate. The hot extract solution was poured into a filter paper in a funnel and into a 50 ml volumetric flask. The crucible and the material on the filter paper were rinsed several times with distilled deionized water. Following these several rinsing, the volume in the flask was brought up to 50 ml with the distilled deionized water. The 50 ml of extract solution was then placed in 120 ml plastic bottles for storage until chemical analysis. The elements Zn, Pb and Cu were determined for each sample using an AA spectrophotometer.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>In 1995, a 0.5 g sample of oven dry ground material from each jar was ashed and eluted by the method described above. The elements Ca and Mg were determined for each sample using an ICP spectrometer. Carbon and nitrogen were determined using oven dried ground material on a CHN analyzer- C and N data are not yet available. These elements are being analyzed by Steve Hamburg at Brown University.</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>CALCULATIONS</title><para><literalLayout>Concentrations of elements in the forest floor were calculated on an oven dry weight basis. Total amounts of the elements were estimated on a per square meter basis by extrapolating up from the 15 x 15 cm sample mass.
