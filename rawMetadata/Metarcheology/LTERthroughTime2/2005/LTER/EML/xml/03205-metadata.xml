Using the four dominant tree species in the watershed, we will study their content and decomposition rates and their effects on subsequent trophic levels. We would like to examine possible effects of increase in diversity on break-down rates, nutrient identity and availability, and microbial and faunal diversity and biomass. Beyond these core questions, we are interested in examining specific terrestrial and aquatic responses to land-use change variables. From this, we hope to determine if leaf litter diversity, a common indicator of land use, has an impact on ecosystem diversity, which may have possible effects on ecosystem function.</para><para>Senesced leaves from the four dominant species will be collected in the fall of 2003, dried, put into litter bags, and placed in the stream and riparian zone over approximately a 30-50 m reach. Sream litter bags will have a 15 mm mesh size and terrestrial litter bags will have a 1 mm mesh size. Three replicate bags per sampling date will be placed randomly in the study area and allowed to decompose. We will sample leaf packs according to anticipated rates of decay. For the stream, this will likely be on days 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160. For the riparian zone, this will likely be on months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, and 36. Three random bags will be retrieved each sampling date. Leaves will be transported on ice in ziplock bags to Athens, GA for processing.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary2017_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>This site is approximately 800 m upstream from the former #20 weir just above where Ball Creek flows under Ball Creek Road.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
