						<para>Spectrophotometer: A. Chlorophyll Extraction (using tissue grinder at DNR Research
							Station) 1. Dim the lights and keep the sample tubes in the freezer: Because
							chlorophyll degrades when exposed to light and heat, this procedure and all others
							associated with analyzing chlorophyll should be carried out in dim light conditions.
							Only one sample tube should be out of the freezer at any one time while the
							pre-grinding or grinding procedure is occurring. Return each tube to the freezer as
							soon as its filter has been ground. 2. Pre-grind filters: Use the sharpened stainless
							steel probe to chop up the filter into small pieces. This should take approximately 2
							minutes. 3. Grind filters: The teflon tip on the tissue grinder should be sanded after
							grinding approximately 5 filters. Grind each filter for 2 minutes. Do not lift the
							teflon tip out of the test tube while the grinder is rotating. Grind the filters by
							attempting to keep the teflon tip in the acetone solution and pressing the tip against
							the filter and the tube. 4. Return the sample tubes to the freezer for 24 hours: Most
							protocols call for extracting the samples in the refrigerator (at 4 degrees C).
							However, after extracting duplicate samples in the freezer and refrigerator (after
							grinding) there was no significant difference in the chlorophyll results. Because past
							samples have been extracted in the freezer, this is the current procedure being used.
							B. Centrifuging the Samples: The samples should be centrifuged as close as possible to
							24 hours after extraction. Before centrifuging the samples, turn on the
							spectrophotometer and enter the correct program number to be sure that it is working
							properly. Perform the procedures below in dim light. 1. Checking acetone volume: In
							dim light, use an identical tube as those used for the samples but with mL marked on
							it, to measure the volume of the acetone in the samples. Measure to the nearest 0.5
							mL. If the sample has any other volume than 5 mL, write the volume on the sample label
							and remember to enter the volume later into the spreadsheet. 2. Loading the
							centrifuge: Making sure that the rubber stoppers are on tight, put tubes with equal
							acetone volumes opposite each other in the centrifuge. If there is an odd tube
							remaining or a tube with a different volume, put a spare tube opposite the sample with
							the same volume of water to counterbalance the centrifuge. 4. Running the centrifuge:
							Turn the speed dial below 40. Turn the timer past 15 minutes. Slowly turn up the speed
							allowing time for the centrifuge to increase in speed. If there is an imbalance in the
							centrifuge (or any other problem), the centrifuge will run much louder than normal. In
							this case, stop the centrifuge and attempt to locate the imbalance. If the centrifuge
							is running smoothly, set the speed at 90 and the timer at 15 minutes. Previously, the
							numbers on the dial were believed to correspond to revolutions per second; however,
							this is not the case, for the centrifuge will only reach rpms of approximately 2500.
							5. Unloading the centrifuge: Allow the centrifuge to come to a stop on its own.
							Carefully take each sample tube out of the centrifuge with minimal mixing. If the
							filter paper is mixed with the liquid, it will be necessary to re-centrifuge the
							sample. Transport the samples to the spectrophotometer in a rack that has tinfoil on
							the sides in order to block out the light. C. Running a Sample: 1. Select the test:
							Allow the spectrophotometer to warm up for at least 15 minutes. Select the proper
							program by pressing the test number followed by Select. 2. Rinse the cuvettes 3 times
							with acetone. It is most efficient to rotate 4 matching 1 cm cuvettes. Try to touch
							the cuvettes only on the opaque sides avoiding touching the clear sides especially on
							the lower half of the cuvette. 3. Run a blank and check that all cuvettes read near 0:
							Add acetone to the 4 matching cuvettes (at least half full), wipe them clean with a
							tissue, and insert them into the spectrophotometer with the labeled sides all facing
							the same direction (always put the tops on the cuvettes when they are in the spec).
							Press Run and the spec. will ask for a blank. Use one of the cuvettes filled with
							acetone as the blank. Once the blank is run, run all of the cuvettes (the cuvette
							position is changed by pulling out the metal rod to the next notched position). All of
							the readings at all wavelengths should be within .001 of 0. If this is not the case,
							remove the suspect cuvette and rinse, wipe, add acetone, and rerun it. Make sure that
							the correct program is being run by checking the wavelengths. The LTER samples should
							be run at 750, 665, 664, 647, and 630 nm. 4. Rinse the pipette tip: Before adding
							sample to a cuvette, the pipette tip should be rinsed with acetone. You should have 2
							different sized beakers, one for waste and one for acetone rinse. Set the 10-1000uL
							pipette to 1000 uL (1 mL) and pipette 1mL of acetone from the rinse beaker and dispose
							of it in the waste beaker. Be sure that the pipette tip is firmly on the pipette
							(press it on the bottom of the rinse beaker). 5. Add sample to a cuvette: Before
							bringing the samples into the spectrophotometer room, turn off the overhead light and
							turn on the desk light in the corner. Carefully remove a sample from the rack and
							pipette approximately 2 mL of sample into a cuvette. Use caution not to suck up any
							filter paper into the pipette; tilt the sample to the side and submerge the pipette
							tip only just below the fluid level. If the pipette tip is getting close to the filter
							paper when removing the second mL of sample, stop pipetting and add the partial mL to
							the cuvette (it is possible to read approximately 1.5 mL of sample). 6. Check the 750
							nm reading and run the sample: Insert the cuvette into the spec. (making sure that the
							labeled side is always facing in the same direction). The default reading on the spec
							is 750 nm. Check to make sure that this reading is less than 0.010 A. If the reading
							is higher, remove the cuvette and re-wipe it with a tissue. If the reading is still
							high, pour the sample back into the tube and re-centrifuge it. To run the sample press
							Run. 7. Acidify the sample: Once the sample has been run, remove it from the spec and
							add 60 uL of 0.1 N HCl (30 uL per 1 mL of sample). Gently shake the sample and wait 90
							seconds to run it. 8. Check the acidification ratio: The before acidorafter acid ratio
							of the LTER samples is usually between 1.3 and 1.7. Compare the two readings to make
							sure the ratio fits in this range. If the ratio is higher than 1.7, re-acidify the
							sample and run it again (the acid probably did not make contact with the sample). 9.
							Rinse the cuvette: After checking the acidification ratio, dispose of the sample in
							the waste beaker and rinse the cuvette 3 times with acetone. Be sure to fill the
							cuvette to the top with acetone during each rinse to be sure that there is not any
							trace of acid left. Running Multiple Samples: 1. It may be more efficient to run 2
							samples before acidification and then run them both after acidification. If this is
							done, take caution to add the correct sample to the correct cuvette and not to mix up
							the samples when they are removed from the spec. for acidification. Recording the
							Results: 1. Write the spec. id number located on the left of the printout onto the
							label of the corresponding sample. Each sample should have a before and an after
							acidification spec. id number written on its label. After all of the samples have been
							run, enter the date of analysis onto the spec. printout. This date will be used to
							identify the spec. printout when the data is proofread (after which proofed from spec.
							printout should be written on the spreadsheet). Clean-up: 1. Rinse the cuvettes 3
							times with acetone, allow them to dry for several minutes in the cuvette rack, and
							return them to their box. 2. Solutions of less than 20percent Acetone can be disposed
							of down the drain followed by at least 10 volumes of water. Fill the waste beaker with
							water and pour the waste down the sink with the water running. Leave the water running
							for several minutes 3. Rinse the beakers and pipette tips 3 times with tap water
							followed by 3 rinses with distilled water. Hang the beakers on the drying rack. &#194;&#160;

						<para>Flourometer: 1. Extracting the Sample: Note: Because Chlorophyll degrades in the
							presence of light (and heat), perform the following procedures in low-light conditions
							A. Add 25 mL of methanol to each film canister. After making sure that the top fits on
							snuggly, shake each canister for 5 seconds. B. Put the film canisters in the
							refrigerator for 24 hours. The film canisters should be shaken again sometime during
							the 24 hour period in the refrigerator. 2. Preparing the Instrument: A. Turn on Turner
							TD-700 Fluorometer at least 30 minutes before analysis. Make sure that the proper lamp
							is installed (Daylight White, marked with a D) and that the correct filters are lined
							up in the filter adapter (Position A). If you change the lamp, be sure to handle it on
							the black rubber area and not on the bulb itself. Refer to the Owners Manual for more
							information (Turner Designs Technical Support has been fairly helpful with questions).
							B. Settings on Turner TD-700 should be set as follows: direct concentration, ugorL Set
							the maximum concentration to 250 ugorL Set the calibration to read 2 standards Set the
							standard concentrations the same as the solid standard readings during the last
							primary standard calibration. C. Read the solid standard on the high and low setting.
							After 30 minutes of warm-up, compare the results to the solid standard measurement the
							known solid standards. Use solid standard R010 for Chl-A Compare readings to known
							standards (High=184.6, Low=30.5) If the current readings vary by more than 5percent
							from the known standards, recalibrate the fluorometer D. Calibrating the Turner
							TD-700. Primary standard calibration should be done at least annually. See calibration
							notes and manual. Start by pressing Enter greater than press 2 for calibration greater
							than Max range 250.0 greater than press 1 for ok greater than number of standards 2
							greater than enter Place standard in fluorometer so the H side is on the left greater
							than press 1 for ok greater than follow instructions greater than press times Flip
							standard so L is on the left side greater than press 1 for ok greater than press times
							Remove standard and replace with original sample holder with the arrow facing left
							Insert blank into fluorometer greater than press enter greater than press 0 Remove
							blank and replace with the solid standard. Re-read high and low. They should read
							184.6 and 30.5, respectively. Note: It is a good idea to perform the above steps
							before extracting the sample to make sure that the fluorometer is functioning properly
							3. Reading the Sample: A. Follow the procedures above for Preparing the Instrument B.
							Allow the film canisters to sit at room temperature for approximately 15 minutes to
							avoid excessive condensation on the glass tubes. C. Record the sample information for
							all of the film canisters on the data sheet D. Add 4 mL of sample to a 13 x 100 mL
							glass tube E. Insert the sample into the fluorometer and record the reading in the
							Fluor Before Acid column. If the sample is over 250 ugorL an OVER message appears and
							the sample must be diluted. It is a good idea to quickly check the reading of a sample
							which is suspected to be to high to get an idea if other samples may need to be
							diluted. If possible read the samples undiluted. If a sample needs to be diluted, use
							an accurate 1000 uL pipette and add 2 mL of methanol to a tube followed by 2 mL of
							undiluted sample (2x Dilution Factor). Shake the tube well before inserting it into
							the fluorometer. If the sample still reads OVER, combine 1 mL of undiluted sample with
							3 mL of methanol (4x Dilution Factor). Be sure to record the dilution information on
							the data sheet. Note that Dilution Factor = Total VolumeorSample Volume where Total
							Volume = Sample Volume plus Methanol Volume G. Acidify the sample by adding 30 uL of
							0.1 N HCl for every one mL of sample (30 uL of 0.1 N HCl is added for each 1 mL of
							sample; 120 uL of acid is added to a 4 mL sample). Then gently shake the sample and
							wait 90 seconds before putting the sample into the fluorometer and recording the
							reading in the Fluor after acid column. To read multiple samples, it is generally a
							good idea to group them in categories (by lake or date) and pipette 4 mL of no more
							than 10 samples into glass tubes. Be sure to keep the samples in the same order that
							you placed them in the tubes. You will then read and record all of the samples before
							acidification, acidify all of the samples, shake them all while they are in the glass
							tube holder, wait 90 seconds, and finally read and record the samples after
							acidification. H. Double check the results and redo samples which have suspicious
							numbers. Make sure that the after-acidification values make sense when compared to the
							before acidification value (the before acidorafter acid ratio should be approximately
							the same for all samples). Note that for samples from Fish Lake in the late summer at
							depths below the thermocline, the after acid readings have been higher than the before
							acid readings. In this case, all numbers should be entered into the excel spreadsheet
							but only the uncorrected chlorophyll a value should be computed. Check that replicate
							samples are approximately the same. 4. Clean up: Methanol can be disposed of down the
							drain as long as water is added to make the solution less than 20percent methanol and
							disposal is followed by at least 10 more volumes of water. Disposal down the drain is
							limited to 10 liters of solvent per day per Principal Investigator. Fill the tubes
							containing methanol with tap water and dispose of down the drain. Keep the faucet
							running for a few minutes. Throw the glass tubes in the glass disposal can. Dispose of
							the remaining methanol in the film canisters and the waste methanol in a similar
							manner. Rinse the film canisters and lids well with tap water and scrub them out with
							a bottle brush making sure to remove any remaining filter paper. Give a final rinse
							with distilled water or Milli-Q and allow to dry. 5. Calculations: The TD700
							Fluorometer is calibrated to display readings in ugorL of Chlorophyll (see TD700
							Manual). The formulas are in the spreadsheets where the data is entered (from EPA
							Method 445.0): Corrected Chlorophyll a (ugorL) = Dilution Factor times (fluor before
							acid &#226;&#128;&#147; fluor after acid) times (Ror(R-1)) times (mL extraction volumeormL filtered
							volume) Uncorrected Chlorophyll a (ugorL) = Dilution Factor times (fluor. before acid)
							times (mL extraction volumeormL filtered volume) Pheophytin a (ugorL) = Dilution
							Factor times ((R times fluor. after acid)-fluor before acid) times (RorR-1) times (mL
							extraction volumeormL filtered volume) where R=acid ratio during primary standard
							calibration (See Calibration of TD700 Fluorometer) &#194;&#160; </para>

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Bog is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a small and shallow bog lake. It has a surface area of 0.5 hectare, mostly undeveloped shoreline and a maximum depth of 2.5 meters.
Bog lakes are isolated to a large extent from surrounding groundwater flow systems. However, they exhibit a similar pattern, across landscapes, to that exhibited by other lakes in general. The proportional input of groundwater to the bogs' hydrologic inputs increases with decreasing elevation in the landscape. More detailed studies of Crystal Bog reveal a complex interplay between conditions in the lake and in the surrounding wetland due to the groundwater flow regime and resulting chemical transfers.

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Lake is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a seepage lake with predominantly sand substrate. It has a surface area of 36.7 hectare, 2.3 kilometers of mostly undeveloped (campground) developed shoreline and a maximum depth of 20.4 meters.
Crystal Lake represents one extreme in the groundwater input gradient, with a marked predominance of precipitation inputs. Groundwater accounts for only 5% of input water, yet, because groundwater is more concentrated chemically than precipitation, groundwater accounts for substantial amounts of incoming solutes. For example, about 50% of the silica budget comes into the lake via groundwater, exerting a major influence on primary production.
The lake is an oligotrophic, dimictic lake high in the landscape with minimal groundwater input, a light attenuation coefficient of 0.24 per meter (average ice-free Secchi depth of 8 m), a mean depth of 11.4 m, and a maximum depth of 20.4 m. Crystal Lake is circular with a shoreline development factor very close to 1.0. The littoral zone is fairly homogenous and is dominated by sandy substrate with low macrophyte and coarse woody habitat densities. The fish community has been historically dominated by pelagic yellow perch. However, yellow perch drastically declined after the detection of rainbow smelt in 1985.
