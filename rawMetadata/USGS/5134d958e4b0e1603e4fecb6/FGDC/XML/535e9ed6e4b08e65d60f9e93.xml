         <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey Energy Resources Program has developed coal databases to monitor the location, quantity, and physical and chemical characteristics of U.S. coal and coal-related deposits.  The National Coal Resources Data System (NCRDS) database is an integrated system utilizing commercial software to produce maps, resource calculations, and coal quality location maps.  NCRDS correlates and standardizes coal data from Federal and State agencies, universities, the private sector, and foreign countries. NCRDS is comprised of three major components, of which two are available online:</abstract>
         <purpose>NCRDS Cooperative Agreements provide geologic information that can be used to support energy resource assessments. The following activities meet the requirements for Cooperative Agreements:

    Collection, entry, or validation of stratigraphic coal data, related chemical and priority GIS data such as outcrop, areas of mining, and other relevant societal or environmental energy-related GIS layers
    Compilation of coalbed gas occurrences, gas storage potential, produced gas and water chemical attributes, well completion and production data, and geotechnical data related to coal conversion processes
    Characterization of organic-rich shales (i.e. hydrocarbon-, gas-, kerogen-rich shales), through geophysical or seismic data, and sample collection for generation of thermal maturity data

Progress Reports will be available in Adobe® (.PDF) format. If you do not have Adobe® Acrobat® you can download a free copy of Adobe® Acrobat® Reader® here.
