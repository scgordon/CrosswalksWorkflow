         <abstract>This dataset consists of a map depicting the distribution of irregular classes along the Natchez Trace Parkway. Irregular classes are those forest alliances that were usually represented by one or two field sites. In addition, these alliances did not align with any of the major forest classes and for the most part did not contain species that were common to other alliances. Ground-based vegetation classification was provided by the National Park Service and mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center.</abstract>
         <purpose>To provide the National Park Service with a separate map of irregular class polygons in the Natchez Trace Parkway.  This shapefile can be layered over the map of the Parkway to identify the location and National Vegetation Classification associations of irregular classes.</purpose>

      <datacred>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), National Wetlands Research Center (NWRC) would like to thank Paul Conzelman and Martha Segura of the National Park Service for allowing us the opportunity to contribute to the landcover mapping of the Nation's resources and Kurt Foote of the National Park Service for his guidance and vital help in our field reconnaissance. Partial funding for this work was provided through the U.S. National Park Service Agreement Number 14431A53200000. We are grateful to Steve Hartley (USGS) for his development of critical geographic information system (GIS) procedures and help in GIS processing.

The USGS NWRC would also like to acknowledge Gulf Coast Aerial Mapping Co., Inc. for the generation of the aerial photography.</datacred>

         <attraccr>National Vegetation Classification data compiled by the National Park Service (NPS) at ground sites throughout the Natchez Trace Parkway were used to assign the class descriptors in the landcover classifications. Out of the 331 total field sites there were 30 sites that did not fit into any of the major landcover classifications. These sites represented 12 alliances that did not occur frequently enough to map with a high degree of accuracy. The analysts attempted to manually map the 12 alliances by identifying unique spectral keys, but were not successful. Eventually the researchers only digitally mapped the alliances that could be seen on the color infrared images; this irregular class on the map included fewer than half of the field sites originally marked irregular (See Table 2 in 'Mapping the Natchez Trace Parkway'). Additional points were added to the map that spectrally matched classified irregular field sites.</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>Visual inspection and automated checking were performed on the data to confirm the integrity of the topology.</logic>
      <complete>Irregular classes noted by the National Park Service that were not distinguishable from adjacent vegetation were not digitized.</complete>

            <procdesc>Color infrared (CIR) aerial photography was acquired during leaf-on conditions. The flights occurred on September 29-30 and October 6 and 15, 2004. The resulting aerial film rolls were then scanned at 25 microns by using a true color, true optics scanner to generate a 1,000-dot per inch (dpi) product and converted to DOQQs. The effects of tilt and relief were removed from the aerial photos by orthorectification.  The transformation of the photographic frames to DOQQ representation provided uniform scale. Uniform scale allowed the direct measure of true distance and direction.  The tiles were then cut to match existing DOQQs in the UTM projection zones.  

The 235 DOQQs created from the 386 aerial frames were mosaiced to create full coverage of the Parkway.  For ease of use, the DOQQs were grouped into 11 mosaics, each covering a section of the Parkway. At the request of the NPS, each mosaic was divided into ten tiles to allow for efficient loading on less robust computers.

            <procdesc>An 11 m by 25 m (average) spectral filter was applied to the DOQQs to produce a scale comparable to the 20 m by 50 m ground-plot size used by the National Park Service. This filter was applied to each of the 11 mosaic sections of the Parkway imagery. The filter minimized unwanted canopy variability (irregularly illuminated tree crowns and canopy gaps and associated shadowing) and maximized forest-stand identification.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>In the field-site classifications received from the National Park Service (NPS), we grouped 30 of the 331 total field sites into an “irregular occurrence” class. Twelve of the 15 alliances included in this group were observed at one to a few sites along the entire Parkway and were often of limited spatial extent. From a mapping perspective, it was highly unlikely these sites would be identified by using the unsupervised classification strategy. For these isolated and comparatively rarely occurring alliances, we formed a spectral key for each and subsequently used a supervised classification strategy to locate other occurrences of that alliance throughout the Parkway. These targeted, supervised classifications were not successful. No spectral key created for these individual alliances provided a unique signature, which is necessary for successful mapping. The high spectral variability and common features of these alliances on color infrared image data prevented determination of unique spectral keys. Where a spectral hue or texture could be identified at the NPS-defined field-site location of the irregular class, manual mapping was performed.</procdesc>
