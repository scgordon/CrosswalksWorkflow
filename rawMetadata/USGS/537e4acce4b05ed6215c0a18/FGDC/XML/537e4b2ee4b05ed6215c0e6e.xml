         <abstract>The Yucaipa 7.5' quadrangle is located at the southeastern margin of the SanBernardino Basin, an extensional region situated within a right-step-over zonebetween the San Jacinto and San Andreas Fault zones.  The quadrangle is traversed byseveral faults of the San Andreas system, including (from oldest to youngest) theBanning Fault and the Wilson Creek, Mission Creek, Mill Creek, and San BernardinoStrands of the San Andreas Fault.
The Mill Creek Strand of the San Andreas Fault is the easternmost strand of the SanAndreas in the Yucaipa quadrangle.  It separates granitic and metamorphic rocks ofthe San Bernardino Mountains block from a thin slice of similar rocks on YucaipaRidge, and thus has only a small amount of strike-slip displacement.
The Wilson Creek Strand traverses Yucaipa Ridge and converges toward the Mlll CreekStrand in the Santa Ana river Canyon.  The fault has juxtaposed an igneous andmetamorphic complex (Wilson Creek block) and overlying nonmarine sedimentary rocks(Mill Creek Formation of Gibson, 1971) against rocks of San BernardinoMountains-type, and thus has significant strike-slip displacement.
The Mission Creek Strand is inferred to lie beneath Quaternary surficial depositsalong the southwestern base of the San Bernardino Mountains.  This fault is themajor strand of the San Andreas Fault zone, and has juxtaposed crystalline rocks ofSan Gabriel Mountains-type (including Pelona Schist overlain by the Vincent Thrustand associated upper-plate crystalline rocks) against the Wilson Creek block and theSan Bernardino Mountains.
The San Bernardino Strand defines the modern trace of the San Andreas Fault.  Thestrand forms primary fault features in all but the youngest Quaternary surficialunits, and is thought to have evolved in the last 125,000 years or so based onregional fault relations.
Complications within the San Andreas Fault system over the last several hundredthousand years have created a landscape setting in which Quaternary surficialmaterials of the Yucaipa quadrangle have accumulated.  Crustal extension throughoutthe San Bernardino Basin region led to uplift of the Crafton Hills block anddown-dropping of the Yucaipa Valley region on faults of the Crafton Hills andChicken Hill complex.  Subsequent middle and late Quaternary streamflows depositedseveral generations of axial-valley and alluvial-fan sediment in the down-droppedlowlands.  These deposits and the older San Timoteo beds they overlie record thehistory of Quaternary fault movements, and form reservoirs for ground water in theYucaipa quadrangle.
Digital Data:
The geologic database of the Yucaipa 1:24,000-scale 7.5' quadrangle, San Bernardinoand Riverside Counties, California, was prepared by the Southern California ArealMapping Project (SCAMP), a regional geologic-mapping project sponsored jointly bythe U.S. Geological Survey and the California Geological Survey.  The database wascreated in ARC/INFO (Environmental Systems Research Institute, ESRI), and includesthe following files: (1) a readme.txt file, (2) this metadata file, (3) coveragescontaining geologic data and station-location data, (4) associated INFO attributedata files, (5) a browse graphic (.pdf) of the geologic-map plot and map-marginalexplanatory information, (6) a PostScript graphics file of the geologic-map plotwith map-marginal explanatory information, and (7) .pdf text files describing themap units of the Yucaipa quadrangle (Description of Map Units) and their geologicage and correlation (Correlation of Map Units).</abstract>
         <purpose>The geologic database for the Yucaipa quadrangle was developed as a contribution tothe National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program's National Geologic Map Database,and is intended to provide a general geologic setting of the quadrangle.  TheYucaipa database provides information about geologic materials and structures,including the modern trace of the San Andreas fault and associated faults that havedeveloped in the map area due to complexities in the San Andreas stress field.
Geologic information contained in the Yucaipa database is general-purpose data thatare applicable to land-related investigations in the earth and biological sciences.The term "general-purpose" means that all geologic-feature classes have minimalinformation content adequate to characterize their general geologic characteristicsand to interpret their general geologic history.  However, no single feature class mayhave enough information to definitively characterize its properties and origin.  Forthis reason the database cannot be used for site-specific geologic evaluations,although it can be used to plan and guide investigations at the site-specific level.</purpose>
         <supplinf>This database is an updated, digital release of an analog map of the Yucaipaquadrangle released previously in the U.S.  Geological Survey Open-file Report (OF)series in 1992 (Matti, J.C., Morton, D.M., Cox, B.F., Carson, S.E., and Yetter,T.J.,1992, Geologic map of the Yucaipa quadrangle, southern California: U.S. GeologicalSurvey Open-File Report 92-445, scale 1:24,000, 14 p.).  Version 1.0 retains much ofthe geologic linear and point data and map-unit information represented in the analogrelease.  However, digital version 1.0 differs from the 1992 analog release in severalimportant ways:
(1) Quaternary surficial materials in the NW part of the quadrangle (Sec.  7, 8, 17,18, 19, 20) and SE corner of the quadrangle (Sec.  7, 8, 11, 12, and unsurveyed) havebeen reinterpreted based on analysis of 1938 and 1953 Department of Agriculture(Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS) aerial photography.
(2) In digital version 1.0, units in the Qa series (Qa, Qya, Qoa, and Qvoa) areidentified as "axial-valley deposits".  In the 1992 analog version, these units weredescribed as "deposits of alluvial plains".  These changes do not affect the geologicinterpretation or information content of the map.  Rather, they are merelynomenclatuaral changes that are the consequence of the U.S.  Geological Survey'scontinued efforts to refine the classification of Quaternary surficial materials in theSan Bernardino-Yucaipa region.
(3) For some faults, digital version 1.0 provides new, geologic data and interpretations.</supplinf>

      <useconst>The Yucaipa 7.5' geologic-map database should be used to evaluate and understand thegeologic character of the Yucaipa quadrangle as a whole.  It should not be used as adetailed map for purposes of site-specific land-use planning or site-specific geologicevaluations.
The database is sufficiently detailed to identify and characterize many actual andpotential geologic hazards represented by faults and landslides and posed by groundsubsidence and earthquake-generated ground shaking.  However, it is not sufficientlydetailed for site-specific determinations or evaluations of these features.  Faultsshown do not take the place of fault-rupture hazard zones designated by the CaliforniaState Geologist (see Hart, 1988).
Use of the Yucaipa geologic-map database should not violate the spatial resolution ofthe data.  Although the digital form of the data allows the scale to be manipulated atthe discretion of the user, detail and accuracy issues that are inherent to map-scalelimitations similarly exist in the digital data.  The fact that this database wasconstructed and edited at a scale of 1:24,000 means that higher-resolution datagenerally are not present in the dataset.  Therefore, plotting at scales larger than1:24,000 will not yield greater, real detail, although enlarged plots may revealfine-scale (artificial) irregularities beyond the intended resolution of the database.Although higher-resolution data may be incorporated at a few places, the resolution ofthe entire database output is limited by the lower-resolution data.

   <dataqual>
      <attracc>
         <attraccr>The combination of detailed and reconnaissance techniques used to generate the Yucaipaquadrangle database yielded a data set whose quality necessarily varies from location tolocation.  Some areas were examined in great detail in order to solve specific geologicproblems or to clarify the description or geologic relations of a particular map unit.Other areas were examined less carefully or were not examined at all.  As a result, someparts of the Yucaipa data set have greater attribute accuracy and attribute confidencethan others.
ATTRIBUTE ACCURACY
The attribute-accuracy statement for the Yuciapa database incorporates four elements:(1) map-unit description and attribution, (2) geotechnical standards against which theobservations are measured, (3) map-unit identification, and (4) description of linearand planar geologic structures.
Map-unit description and attribution:
Geologic-map units in the Yucaipa quadrangle database were described using standardfield methods (see Process_Description 1 of 6).  Consistent with these methods andconsistent with the time available to assemble the data set, the database authors haveassigned standard geologic attributes to geologic lines, points, and polygons identifiedin the database.
Geotechnical standards for geologic descriptions:
Plutonic rock classification:  Plutonic rocks and their deformed equivalents areclassified in accordance with the International Union of Geological SciencesSubcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks (1973; Streckeisen, 1976).
Sedimentary rock classifications:  Sandstones are classified in accordance with thescheme suggested by Friedman and Sanders (1978, Table 7-4).  For all sedimentarymaterials, bedding-thickness classification follows Ingram (1954) and grain-sizeclassification follows Wentworth (1922).
Surficial-materials classification:  Surficial materials are mapped and classifiedaccording to a southern California-wide classification scheme being developed by theSouthern California Areal Mapping Project (SCAMP).
Terminology for slope-failure deposits (landslides and other slope-failure types)follows Varnes (1978).
Color classification:  The matrix color of surficial materials and their pedogenic soilsis classified according to the Munsell soil-color charts (Munsell, 1975).  Bedrockcolors also are classified according to the Munsell system, supplemented by theRock-Color Chart distributed by the Geological Society of America (reprinted 1970).
Map-unit identification
Geologic-map units in the Yucaipa quadrangle represent packages of geologic materialswhose overall physical properties differ sufficiently from other such units as toconstitute discrete mappable entities.  From localities where map units in thequadrangle first were recognized and defined, they were extended to other areas througha mapping process that includes (a) direct outcrop observation, (b) interpretation ofsubsurface boring logs, and (c) aerial-photographic extrapolation into areas where siteobservation was not conducted.  The data contained in the coverage yuc_obs indicates thedensity of observation and data localities in the Yucaipa quadrangle, and is a measureof whether a map unit at a particular location was identified on the basis of hands-ondata or extrapolation.
Map-unit boundaries (geologic contacts) and faults identified along mapping traversestypically were extended laterally by using aerial photographs and binoculars to projector interpolate the contact or fault to its next recorded occurrence along a nearbytraverse.  Only rarely were individual geologic contacts or fault lines walked out todetermine their variability and character throughout the map area.  The boundingcontacts of each surficial unit and the location of fault scarps that traverse the unitswere plotted by using a PG-2 photogrammetric plotter that allows location accuracyequivalent to the accuracy standard for the topographic-contour base.
Description of geologic structures
Geologic structures (planar structures displayed as lines, and structures at specificpoints) in the Yucaipa quadrangle are described and attributed according to the schemedescribed by Matti and others (1997a,b).  These classifications generally followconventional schemes for classifying geologic lines and points (Reynolds and others,1995).
ATTRIBUTE CONFIDENCE
For digital version 1.0 of the database, the coverage yuc_obs is a proxy for attributeconfidence:  the number of direct observations within a map unit from place to place inthe quadrangle proxies for the confidence with which the unit and its attributes arebelieved to be accurately identified.  Future releases of the Yucaipa data set willdelineate a more objective, empirical basis for map-unit identification and attributeaccuracy (map-unit and attribute confidence).

      <logic>Polygon and chain-node topology present.
The areal extent of the map is represented digitally by an appropriately projected(Polyconic projection), mathematically generated box.  Consequently, polygons intersectingthe lines that comprise the map boundary are closed by that boundary.  Polygons internalto the map boundary are completely enclosed by line segments that are themselves a set ofsequentially numbered coordinate pairs.  Point data are represented by coordinate pairs.</logic>
      <complete>The geologic map and digital database of the Yucaipa 7.5' quadrangle contain new datathat have been subjected to scientific peer review and are a substantially completerepresentation of the current state of knowledge concerning the geology of thequadrangle.
Information for geologic units, geologic contacts, and faults by necessity isgeneralized.  Although derived from data collected at individual observation stations,the characteristics of map units, their bounding contacts, and faults have been averagedand reduced to attributes that describe each map unit and each line element as a whole.This averaging process is necessary because of the intrinsic variability that geologicunits, contacts, and faults display spatially: in detail, their characteristicsnecessarily vary geographically, although certain core attributes persist.  To accountfor this variability and yet still characterize the major defining attributes ofgeologic entities, the database authors have selected and archived certain geologiccharacteristics but omitted others.  In such cases, details were sacrificed in theinterest of defining the average character of the geologic features.
Map-unit completeness: For map-unit polygons, version 1.0 of the Yucaipa database doesnot exploit the full potential afforded by the data-model and attribute scheme proposedby Matti and others (1997a).  The file yuc_geo.pat contains limited information aboutpolygon themes such as geologic name and the thickness of geologic-map units, as well asinformation about unique attributes that distinguish a map unit within a polygon or aparticular subset of polygons.  Additional lithologic-attribute data are available inthe INFO data table yuc_summ.rel, including age-related data and major rock type.  Otherthan this minimal information, however, the Yucaipa database for geologic-map units(yuc_geo) lacks the comprehensive information content of the .pdf files (yuc_dmu.pdf andyuc_cmu.pdf).
Line and Point Completeness: For line and point data, the Yucaipa database exploits theattribution scheme proposed by Matti and others (1997a,b).  This scheme allows geologicelements represented as lines (geologic contacts, faults, fold axes, geomorphicfeatures) and points (bedding orientations, foliation orientations, fault dips) to beassigned a full spectrum of attributes ranging from contact and fault type to geologicage of linear and point features.  Some of these attributes are embedded directly withinthe line and point data bases (.aat and .pat, respectively).  Most line and pointattributes are stored as codes in two INFO data tables (lines.rel and points.rel).

            <horizpar>Nationwide geologic-map accuracy standards for geologic line and point features have notbeen developed and adopted by the U.S.  Geological Survey and other earth-scienceentities.  Until such standards are developed, the Southern California Areal MappingProject (SCAMP) uses internal map-accuracy standards for 1:24,000-scale geologic mapsproduced by the project.
In the Yucaipa 1:24,000 scale quadrangle, geologic lines are judged to meet themap-accuracy standard if they are located to within &#x98;+/-15 meters relative to topographicor cultural features on the base map.  Within the database, line data that are judged tomeet the map-accuracy standard are denoted in the data table lines.rel by the attributecode .MEE. (meets); line data that may not meet the map-accuracy standard are denoted bythe attribute code .MNM. (may not meet).  On geologic-map plots and other plotsgenerated from the geologic database, line data that are judged to meet the map-accuracystandard are denoted by solid lines; line data that may not meet the map-accuracystandard are denoted by dashed or dotted lines.
In the database and on geologic-map plots, no cartographic device exists for denotingthe map-accuracy for geologic-point data (symbols for bedding, foliation, lineations,etc.).
Three sources of positional error exist for geologic elements in the Yucaipa quadrangledatabase:
(1) Positional accuracy of field observations: observation stations (data localities)were located either on aerial photographs or on the topographic basemap of the Yucaipaquadrangle by referencing hypsographic and planimetric features on the basemap.
(2) Transfer of line and point data from aerial photographs to the topographic base:For bedrock geologic materials, point data, contacts, and faults were visuallytransferred to scale-stable copies of the topographic base map.  For most surficialgeologic materials, geologic contacts and fault scarps were transferred to the base mapthrough the use of a PG-2 sterographic plotter that allows geologic elements to belocated with an accuracy and precision equivalent to the standard for thetopographic-contour base.
(3) Positional fidelity during digital data processing: the maximum transformation RootMean Square (RMS) error acceptable for 7.5' quadrangle transformation and data input is0.003 (1.8 meters).  The horizontal positional accuracy of line and point entities waschecked by visual comparison of hard-copy plots with base-stable source data.</horizpar>

Geologic data for the Yucaipa quadrangle were collected in the field by the data-setauthors.  The field data were plotted on aerial photographs and on a 1:24,000-scalebasemap (U.S. Geological Survey, Yucaipa 7.5' quadrangle, 1967, photorevised, 1980).
Bedrock map units were described, mapped, and interpreted on the basis oftraverse-mapping methods.  Observations were recorded along each traverse, locations forwhich are stored in the coverage yuc_obs. Information recorded at these stationsprovides the basis for the identification and characterization of each bedrock mapunit..  Map-unit boundaries (geologic contacts) and faults identified along eachtraverse typically were extended laterally by using aerial photographs and binoculars toproject or interpolate the fault or contact to its next recorded occurrence along anearby traverse.  A few sedimentary-layering attitudes were determined through binocularobservation rather than from site determinations; these are identified in the data baseand on the geologic-map plot.
Surficial-materials map units were described, mapped, and interpreted on the basis ofaerial-photographic interpretation augmented by observations at specific stations.  Thebounding contacts of each surficial unit and the location of fault scarps that traversethe units were plotted by using a PG-2 photogrammetric plotter that allows locationaccuracy equivalent to the accuracy standard for the topographic-contour base.  Thecoverage yuc_obs shows the position of observation stations data from which were used todetermine geologic characteristics of the surficial map units.

The basemap image (yuc.tif) was prepared by scanning a scale-stable right-reading,blackline .007-mil clear-film positive of the U.S.  Geological Survey, 1:24,000-scaleYucaipa 7.5' quadrangle topographic map (1967, photorevised, 1980).  Scanning was doneusing an Anatech Eagle 4080 monochrome 800 dots-per-inch scanner at a resolution of 500dpi.  The raster scan was converted to a monochromatic image in ARC/INFO.  No elements ofthe base layer are attributed.  The base map is provided for reference only.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>Digital Preparation of Geologic-map Information
Geologic line and point data on scale-stable greenline chronoflex copies of the Yucaipa7.5' quadrangle were digitized and simultaneously converted to ARC/INFO coveragesthrough the application and utilization of the graphical user interface ALACARTEdeveloped by the USGS (Fitzgibbon, 1991; Fitzgibbon and Wentworth, 1991; Wentworth andFitzgibbon, 1991) running on a Data General Aviion workstation.  The databasesubsequently was edited and tagged on a Sun SPARC20 computer system running Solaris v.2.4 and ARC/INFO v. 7.0.4 and v.  7.1.1.  Geologic point data were captured usingALACARTE and ARC/INFO v.7.0.4.

            <procdesc>Observation-station coverage yuc_obs
The coverage yuc_obs contains the locations of observation stations that the datasetauthors used to describe geologic materials and geologic structures in the Yucaipaquadrangle.  Several kinds of observation stations are included:
(1) Field observations made by the dataset authors.  These are represented by theauthor's name (e.g., Jonathan C.  Matti), and the station ID (e.g., JF, which representsJ.C. Matti, notebook F);
(2) Subsurface borings obtained by the California Department of Transportation atoverpassing and underpassing right-of-ways along the Interstate and State Highwaysystems;
(3) Subsurface borings obtained by the U.S. Geological Survey's Water Resources Division(WRD);
(4) Subsurface borings obtained by various private geotechnical-engineering firms;
(5) Soil-profile descriptions obtained by the Natural Resources and Conservation Service(Woodruff and Brock, 1980, sheet 10);

      <overview>
         <eaover>The ARC/INFO version of the digital geologic database of the Yucaipa 7.5'quadrangleconsists of five coverages:&gt;yuc_geo (geologic map units and linear geologic entities)&gt;yuc_pts (geologic point features)&gt;yuc_obs (distribution of data stations)&gt;yuc_ptsorn (geologic line ornamentation)&gt;yuc_ldr (map-unit label leaders).Three additional INFO tables are included in the data set:yuc_summ.rel (provides general information about each geologic-map unit, includinggeneral lithologic features, geologic age, and geologic origin which applies to allpolygons of a specified map unit)
lines.rel - (provides information about geologic features displayed as lines on the map.For a complete description of attributes in lines.rel, refer to USGS Open-File Report97-861: see Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation)
points.rel - (provides information about geologic features displayed as points on themap.  For a complete description of attributes in points.rel, refer to USGS Open-FileReport 97-859: see Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation)
1)  The coverage yuc_geo contains information about geologic-map units (represented bypolygons) and planar geologic features that bound or break them (e.g. geologic contactsand faults) represented by lines.  The polygons have cartographic and geologicattributes contained in yuc_geo.pat; the lines have cartographic and geologic attributescontained in yuc_geo.aat.  For display purposes, the geology coverage contains twoannotation subclasses: geo contains unit labels, and fault contains formal fault names.
2)  The coverage yuc_pts contains analyzable structural data, including information thatdescribes the types and orientation of planar and linear geologic features such asbedding, foliation, fault-plane dip, and fold-hinge plunge. One annotation subclass isincluded in the geologic points coverage which displays the respective dip and plungevalues associated with individual point data.
3)  The coverage yuc_obs contains point data that repesent the locality of data stationsassociated with multiple authors and sources, all of which have contributed geologicdata.  The locality data represented in yuc_obs serves several purposes: (1) as a proxyfor author confidence in unit identification, (2) as a means of identifying eachauthor's contribution, and (3) as a means of identifying data from sources other thanthe USGS authors.  One annotation subclass, obs, identifies five particular locations:four Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil profile description localitiesand one USGS Water Resource Division (WRD) well-log data locality.
4)  The coverage yuc_ptsorn stores point data that represent ornamentation for geologiclines (e.g. strike slip arrows, bar and ball on down-thrown block, etc.)
5)  The coverage yuc_ldr contains annotation leaders that point to unit labels that areplaced outside the perimeter of a particular geologic polygon.  These cartographic lineentities are attributed with only  a single attribute, L-SYMB, and all have the samevalue, 1.</eaover>

            <attrdef>A reference label for subgroups of polygons of the geologic-map unit identified by LABL.Every polygon subgroup has certain attributes in common with all other polygons of the mapunit, but each subgroup has unique, distinguishing attributes that warrant recognition inthe database although those distinguishing characteristics do not provide a basis forrecognizing new map units (for example, geographic variations in properties such as grainsize, thickness, and clast compositiion).
TAG serves one additional purpose: it functions as the relate item that associates eachpolygon with its attributes stored in the polygon-attribute data table, YUC_SUMM.REL.
TAG is defined as LABL followed by an upper-case letter, e.g., QwA, QwB, or QwC, etc.Most map units in the Yucaipa databse have only one TAG designation, TAG A; map unitshaving polygon subsets representing characteristics sufficiently distinct from those ofthe overall unit include: Qw (QwA, QwB), Qf (QfA, QfB), Qya4 (Qya4A, Qya4B), Qya5(Qya5A, Qya5B), Qvof3 (Qvof3A, Qvof3B0, Tgr (TgrA, TgrB).</attrdef>
