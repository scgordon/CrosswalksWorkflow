         <abstract>
The trophic ecology of Everglades fishes is poorly documented. In tropical-fish communities, hydrologic seasonality greatly affects patterns of food-resource use, such as local and long-range movements among habitats, seasonal changes in diets, diet specializations, the presence and seasonality of diet overlaps, etc. (Lowe-McConnell 1975; Winemiller 1989, 1990).

We analyzed Everglades native and introduced fish diets to identify the most important invertebrate and plant prey, and to compare trophic positions of species within and among three habitats and two seasons (Fig. 1). We used the complementary techniques of stomach and stable isotope analysis for both instantaneous and time-integrated views of animal diets (Vander Zanden and Rasmussen 1996).

We then compared diet patterns in the temperate Everglades fish community with those from seasonal aquatic systems in the tropics. We posed the following hypotheses in examining those patterns:

1: Herbivory and omnivory are common trophic states in the Everglades.

2: Seasonal changes in diets within a habitat are usual .

3: Specialization in diet is common; generalists are rare.

4: Diet overlap is highest during high-water periods when food is plentiful.

This study is a first step in using data from across habitats and seasons for use in constructing a empirical food web for the Everglades marsh.

         <purpose>In modeling the dynamics of aquatic animal populations in southern Florida wetlands, the dispersal distances, rates of movements, and timing of movement are important but poorly understood. The small size of the wetland animals precludes the use of standard marking techniques for studying movement, and the large, open system of these wetlands makes recapturing marked animals improbable. Genetic markers, used to determine population structure, offer an indirect way of assessing the degree of movement and mixing in these populations, and the landscape-level patterns of animal movement. In a series of studies in this multi-year project, our objectives are to identify population structure of selected aquatic species in the Everglades and to estimate migration rate from genetic data on gene flow for incorporation in the ATLSS model. Data from studies on whether levee and canal systems act as barriers to dispersal of aquatic animals in the Everglades are applicable to the Restudy. We are also using genetic techniques to learn if populations of introduced Asian Swamp Eels have the same source of origin, thereby establishing whether new collection locations represent dispersal events or new introductions.</purpose>

Approximately 4,000 specimens of 26 native fishes collected by rotenone, nets, angling, and electrofishing from 1977-1981 were supplemented by 6 introduced species during 1995-1997.

Each species was separated into arbitrarily chosen size-groups of ~ 25 fish; length and wet mass recorded.

Volumes were measured to 0.001ml using a blood-sedimentation tube; volume of digested prey not reconstructed; The small size of food items required the pooling of like items from each size-class of fish for volumetric analysis.

Trophic Classification

We grouped fishes into 5 Trophic Classes using continuous scores (tau symboli ) based on sums of prey scores, multiplied by the proportion of diet comprised by each prey type (Adams et al. 1983; Winemiller 1990).

1 = Mainly Herbivorous, &gt;50% plant material (Score = 1.0 -1.74);

2 = Omnivorous, 25-50% plant material (Score = 1.75-2.19);

3 = Omnivorous, &lt;25% Plant material (Score = 2.20-2.74);

4 = Omnivorous, mostly animal prey (Score = 2.75-2.99);

5 = Predominantly carnivorous, fish and decapods (Score = &gt;3.0).

The results were used to identify the most important invertebrate and plant prey and to compare trophic positions of species among and within 3 habitats (alligator pond, spike rush, and sawgrass) and two seasons (high-water and low-water periods).
