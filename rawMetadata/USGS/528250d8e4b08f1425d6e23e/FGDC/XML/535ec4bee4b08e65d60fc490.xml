         <abstract>
This is the 1st release of the fourth version of an Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) digital elevation model (DEM) generated from certified airborne height finder (AHF) and airboat collected ground surface elevations for the  Greater Everglades Region. Collectively, these data are referred to as "High Accuracy Elevation Data" (HAED). This version differs from the previous elevation model (EDEN_EM_OCT07) in several ways.  First, the kriging algorithm applied to newly modeled subareas was changed from ordinary to universal kriging - resulting in slightly lower errors during cross-validation and accuracy assessment. Second, a previously omitted area in the southern portion of the Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP) and the northwestern corner of the Everglades National Park (ENP) has been filled. Third, to increase accuracy in Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA1), the most challenging EDEN subarea from an elevation modeling standpoint, the Conservation area is subdivided into 3 zones (North, Central, South).  Boundaries between the North, Central and South zones are based upon landscape units defined in the CERP Monitoring and Assessment Plan, Part 1, Figure 3-20 on p. 3-38 (p. 36 in the pdf file) at http://www.evergladesplan.org/pm/recover/recover_docs/map/MAP_3.1_GE.pdf.

The South landscape unit (representing approximately the southern third of WCA1) was further divided into two zones (east and west, termed "Southeast" and "Southwest") based on marked changes in slope and aspect data generated from a DEM of the South landscape unit as a whole.  Division of WCA1 into 4 zones reduces errors estimated by comparing DEM modeled water depths with those measured by EDEN Principal Investigators in the field.  Subdivision of the South landscape unit into east and west zones resulted in lower error estimates for the Southeast zone without significantly affecting (i.e., improving or degrading) the quality of the Southwest zone - an area where DEM modeling is most challenging.  To reduce artificial breaks in elevation along WCA1 subarea boundaries, models were overlapped by 1 cell at these boundaries and, for the North, Central and South zone boundaries, overlapping model values were averaged.  For the boundaries between the Southwest and Southeast zones, cell values were "blended" based on weighted distance from the boundary edge.  Finally, points along the North / Central and Central / South zone edges were subjectively selected and changed by adding or subtracting 0.03 meters (3 cm) to particular cells based on nearby cell values.  This slightly reduces apparent artifacts without drastically affecting the integrity of the model. The EDEN offers a consistent and documented dataset that can be used to guide large-scale field operations, to integrate hydrologic and ecological responses, and to support biological and ecological assessments that measure ecosystem responses to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.  To produce historic and near-real time maps of water depths, the EDEN requires a system-wide DEM of the ground surface.

      <logic>The EDEN monitoring network includes ground-elevation measurements and continuous water-level data.</logic>
      <complete>Ground-surface elevation data were collected by the USGS at more than 50,000 points with an approximate spacing of 400 meters covering almost the entire Greater Everglades.  The EDEN water-level network consists of hourly water-level data from 253 gaging stations (230 existing gaging stations and 23 new installations) and includes freshwater (nontidal) marsh gaging stations, boundary gages on canals, and coastal gaging stations operated by the Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP), Everglades National Park (ENP), South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), and USGS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and SFWMD recently documented or surveyed a majority of the hydrologic gages in the Greater Everglades to obtain correct values for converting water-level data from NGVD 29 to NAVD 88.  The NAVD 88 datum is consistent in comparing water-level data across the Greater Everglades and computing accurate water depths.</complete>
      <posacc>
         <horizpa>
            <horizpar>Horizontal positions are established by GPS observations and are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  The desired horizontal accuracy is +/- 15 centimeters.  This level of accuracy is consistent with GPS differential techniques which use two stations - a high-quality dual-frequency GPS receiver base station and a roving GPS station. The density and accuracy of a given GPS data observation varies from a few meters to a few centimeters according to the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) in the study area.  Generally if the PDOP is observed to be excessive, data collection is discontinued or the data are discarded.  The PDOP is an indicator of the positional accuracy of the GPS that be can derived from the current GPS satellite geometry, which varies continuously.  Generally the smaller the PDOP number, the higher the data quality.  The PDOP is a permanent part of the recorded data and is also included in the post processing procedures during reduction of the GPS observations to NAD 83.  Where possible, the GPS base station has an ellipsoid height to an accuracy of two centimeters relative to the Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) or the High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN), both operated by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS).</horizpar>

The EDEN domain was broken into a large number of equal-sized rectangles (cells) that in total are referred to as the "grid".  Characteristics of this grid, such as location of the centroid, the representative area of the Everglades, elevation, and percentage of vegetation type, define the grid spatial parameters.  To match the Airborne Height Finder (AHF) data sampling spacing, the spatial resolution or the dimension (in ground distance) of each grid cell is 400 meters on each side. The ground surface DEM development process is iterative as additional high accuracy elevation data (HAED) are collected, water surfacing algorithms improve, and additional ground-based ancillary data become available.  This version was produced by using all available AHF points posted to SOFIA as of August 2007.

To create a realistic region-wide elevation model for EDEN purposes, the elevation data were segregated by Water Conservation Areas and National Park boundaries so that local trends could be isolated, sub-region specific interpolation models could be developed, and realistic breaks in elevation along sub-region boundaries could be imbedded in a final, region-wide DEM.

For the previous release of the DEM, subarea DEMs were produced using the geostatistical approach called "anisotropic ordinary kriging". This version is composed of new models created for each new EDEN subarea in Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA1) and for the new coverage in the southern portion of BCNP and the northwest corner of the ENP.  For the latest iteration of the EDEN DEM "anisotropic universal kriging" was employed.

As with the previously released DEM, WCA1 surfaces were produced by removing all "upland" AHF points.  However, in this version WCA1 "upland" was defined through a reclassification of the South Florida Water Management Vegetation Map rather than the Florida GAP map.

As the most challenging area from an elevation modeling standpoint, for this revision WCA1 was further subdivided into a total of 4 zones.  First, boundaries between the North, Central and two South zones are based upon landscape units defined through the CERP Monitoring and Assessment Plan, Part 1 (Figure 3-20).  Then the South landscape unit (representing approximately the southern third of WCA1) was further divided into two zones (east and west, termed "Southeast" and"Southwest") based on marked changes in slope and aspect data that were generated from a DEM of the South landscape unit as a whole.  Division of WCA1 into 4 zones reduces errors estimated by comparing DEM modeled water depths with those measured by EDEN Principal Investigators in the field.  Subdivision of the south landscape unit into east and west zones resulted in lower error estimates for the Southeast zone without significantly affecting (i.e., improving or degrading) the quality of the Southwest zone - an area where DEM modeling is most challenging.

A previously omitted area in the southern portion of the Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP) and the northwestern corner of the Everglades National Park (ENP) has been filled.
