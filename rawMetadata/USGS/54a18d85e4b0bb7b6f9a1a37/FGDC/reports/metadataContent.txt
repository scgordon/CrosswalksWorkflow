54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a1905ae4b0bb7b6f9a1a3c.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC. NLCD 2011 is the most up-to-date iteration of the National Land Cover Database, the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation. The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition, amended 2014) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition, amended 2014). For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center. In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products were revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail). All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis: Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP - http//fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits, imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis: For the NLCD 2011 Land Cover Update, a variation of the Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) used in NLCD 2006 spectral change analysis was refined to capture land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin et al. 2013). Four indices were integrated into one model to more accurately detect true spectral changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2006) and late date (circa 2011) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification: Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2006 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2006 and 2011 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2011 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product): Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover Version (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product): A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change: The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition)and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This land cover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered "provisional" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 Edition) for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. Questions about the NLCD the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

No formal independent accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition land cover has been made. The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability. Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for land cover predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design. For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition land cover modeling, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size. For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples). This process was repeated 5 times. After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs were computed. Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment. This land cover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered "provisional" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.

The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data is required. For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover, training data were collected from several combined sources. Note that the training data were used to map all land cover classes except for four classes in urban and sub-urban areas (developed open space, low intensity developed, medium intensity developed, high intensity developed). All urban and suburban land cover classes were mapped and quality assessed separately through a sub-pixel quantification of impervious surfaces using a regression tree modeling method. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps were required to complete the final land cover product. The four classes in urban and suburban areas were determined from the percent imperviousness mapping product (described in the next section). The threshold for the four classes is: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). Other classes of forest and non-forest were combined with the urban classes to complete the land cover product. Finally visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an "area of interest" (AOI), subsequently then limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI. The completed single pixel product was then generalized to a 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) minimum mapping unit product using a "smart eliminate" algorithm. This aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to a 5-pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.

This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern half of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions.

NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a19578e4b0bb7b6f9a1a4b.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture -Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC. NLCD 2011 is the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation. The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition, amended 2014) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition, amended 2014). For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover; 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness; 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels; and 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center. In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail). All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 products can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

For NLCD 2011 change analysis, two, two-date pairs of Landsat scenes were selected for each path/row to represent ground conditions in circa 2006 and 2011. One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium-intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2011 Land Cover Update, a variation of the Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) used in NLCD 2006 spectral change analysis was refined to capture land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin et al. 2013). Four indices were integrated into one model to more accurately detect true spectral changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2006) and late date (circa 2011) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2006 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2006 and 2011 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2006 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition) and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a195a1e4b0bb7b6f9a1a4d.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001 2011 Edition) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006 2011 Edition) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 (2011 edition) is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 (2011 Edition) and 2006 (2011 Edition) for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition), there are 4 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition); 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Land Cover Change Pixels (2011 Edition) labeled with the 2006 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition), and 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (2011 Edition). In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates included in the attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered "provisional" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions.

NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a195cbe4b0bb7b6f9a1a50.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The National Land Cover Database 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge-matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. Questions about the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness 2011 Edition can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

No formal independent accuracy assessment for this product has been made. The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping protocols offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability. Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for imperviousness predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design. For each mapping zone, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size. For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples). This process was repeated 5 times. After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs was computed. Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment.

Training data were selected based on the degree of variance each training data set possesses with regards to Landsat ETM+ imagery used for mapping. Each added training data set decreased the amount of variance present within the Landsat data as a whole. The selection process was repeated until the amount of variance explained reached a pre-defined threshold. By combining the training data with Landsat spectral data and other ancillary data, percent imperviousness prediction models were developed using a regression tree algorithm (named "Cubist"). All data layers used as input for running the Cubist, in order to establish the prediction model for imperviousness are listed in the "Supplemental Information" section. Three ancillary data sets were used for urban/suburban delineation masking, which is essential to confine the imperviousness mapping within the developed areas. After the best combination of possible input data layers had been determined and the final percent impervious layer produced, the urban mask created was used to eliminate those pixels from the final percent impervious file that fall outside identified impervious surface areas. Thus, the impervious pixels identified within the mask were retained, while all non-impervious surface pixels were removed from the final product. This corrected for any small areas of pixels that may have been included as part of the impervious surface layer because their spectral signature was not covered in the Cubist modeling process. Finally, visual inspection of imperviousness layer was made with limited manual editing to eliminate non-urban areas based on area of interest delineated by the mapping team.

This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions.

NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a195e3e4b0bb7b6f9a1a52.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001 2011 Edition) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006 2011 Edition) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 (2011 edition) is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 (2011 Edition) and 2006 (2011 Edition) for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition), there are 4 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition); 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Land Cover Change Pixels (2011 Edition) labeled with the 2006 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition), and 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (2011 Edition). In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates included in the attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered "provisional" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions.

NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a19635e4b0bb7b6f9a1a55.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The 2010 North American Land Cover data set was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries. The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each countrys specific requirements. The initial data set of North American Land Cover at 250 meters reflected land cover information for 2005. This 2010 data set was produced by updating the 2005 data to show land cover changes as determined from more recent data. No changes were mapped in Hawaii because newer data were not available. Land cover classification changed between 2005 and 2010 for approximately 1 percent of the continental area. For the continental data sets (including surrounding water fringe) 4150241 pixels (1.03% of the area) changed in the update. The following national counts exclude the water fringe: Canada, 3264779 pixels changed (2.05%); Mexico, 47070 pixels changed (0.15%), and U.S., 836706 pixels changed (0.55%). The initial data set used to generate land cover information over North America was produced by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing from observations acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra). All seven land spectral bands were processed from Level 1 granules into top-of-atmosphere reflectance covering North America at a 250-meter spatial and 10-day temporal resolution. In order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by INEGI, CONABIO, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each country used specific training data and land cover mapping methodologies to create national data sets. This North America data set was produced by combining the national land cover data sets. The countries worked together to produce a definitive list of land cover classifications for the 2005 data; the same classifications were used for the 2010 data. This document is available for download from the same site as the data and is entitled: North American Land Cover Classifications (2005).
54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a19635e4b0bb7b6f9a1a55.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|Information on land cover across North America provided by this data set is valuable for a range of audiences, including international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme, nongovernmental conservation organizations, land managers, and scientific researchers. The continental scale land cover data generated under NALCMS can be used to address issues such as climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity loss, and changes in ecosystem structure and function, by helping users to better understand the dynamics and continental-scale patterns of North Americas changing environment. The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, the U.S. Geological Survey, or the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in the use of these data.
54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a19635e4b0bb7b6f9a1a55.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|The standard distribution formats for this data set are listed below. Users interested in receiving the data as a GRID or BIN file may contact the CEC. Land cover monitoring, the goal of the NALCMS project, requires multiple land cover maps, ideally at annual intervals. It has been shown that post-classification change detection, i.e. the comparison of two land cover maps, does not yield satisfying results because it highly overestimates changes. Therefore, the NALCMS builds upon a two-step approach that 1) estimates the change between two sample years, also called maximum potential change, and 2) updates the classification of only those pixels that were identified as potential change. This process ensures that changes in classification will only focus on areas where a previous algorithm detected the potential for change and the remainder of the map remains without modifications.

Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution.

Areas of potential change were identified and then reclassified as necessary. Country-specific processes are described in this process step and the ones below. Please see the points-of-contact if additional processing information is needed. For Canada, the 2010 land cover was derived from a time series of land cover, developed for Canada from 2000 to 2010 at an annual time step, using MODIS data as input (Pouliot et al., 2013). The method used to update land cover for each year in the time series followed a change- and evidence-based classification approach. It was applied separately for six mapping zones. Mapping zones were selected to have similar spectral and land cover properties that could be optimized within the zone so as to reduce class confusion. Change detection was a critical step, as the basic premise of the method required changes to be detected with high confidence. Three methods were used to capture different types of change and at different temporal scales. Annual negative change results were generated in previous research by Guindon et al. (2011), which mostly captured forest-stand-replacing disturbances such as harvesting and fire. New methods were developed to capture annual positive change in disturbed areas and to account for subtle multi-year change of either a negative or positive nature. Negative change refers to vegetation loss and positive change to vegetation establishment and growth. In the context of multi-year change, examples of the negative case include recurrent insect defoliation, gradual urbanization, and persistent climatic or hydrological alteration. For the positive case, examples include gradual regeneration of disturbed areas and climate-related vegetation change. To predict the new land cover label for a change area, several sources of evidence were combined including the class membership output from a decision tree classifier, class temporal transition likelihood, and regional and neighbourhood class proportions. The class with the maximum combined evidence was taken as the updated land cover label. A base land cover map for 2005 was used for the update and served as the classification training data source. To capture class temporal variability, training samples were taken for pixels that had not changed within plus or minus 1 year of the base map. Temporal filtering of the time series was the final step applied to remove highly improbable land cover transitions once all maps in the time series were processed. Several sources of ancillary data were incorporated in the classification to develop or refine the initial base map. These included a 250-meter spatial resolution water fraction map assembled from the National Topographic Data Base at 1:2500000 scale (Palvic and Latifovic, 2007), digital elevation data at 1:50000 scale, Canada road network data at 1:250000 scale converted to road density within a 250 meter grid cell, and an indicator of the Taiga class likelihood based on proximity to the northern treeline (Timoney et al., 1992) and conifer class density measured within a 50x50 pixel window of the 2005 land cover base map. Exponentially decreasing membership functions were defined for the distance and density layers and multiplied to calculate the final Taiga likelihood estimate.

Image data from 2010 were normalized to the corresponding band and month from 2005 using Theil-Sen regression (Olthof et al. 2005). Next, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. Based on the NDVI, textural Laplace and Sobel filters with 3x3 kernel size were applied to enhance change detection along land cover edges. In total a set of 120 data layers were used: data for 7 spectral bands, NDVI, Sobel, and Laplace filters (10 data layers), for 12 months of the year. This set of data layers was produced for both 2005 and 2010, and compared between the two subject years. A small difference in values between the 2005 and 2010 data indicates areas that have not changed, whereas extreme negative and positive values indicate changes. For areas of change, the most appropriate lower and upper cut-off thresholds in the difference image histogram (lower and upper quantile) must be determined, and also the frequency, i.e. number of times, out of the 120 data layers used for comparison, that a pixel should be flagged as changed. The appropriate threshold values for the lower quantile, upper quantile, and frequency were defined by training an algorithm using pairs of Landsat images from April (the end of the dry season) and October (the end of the rainy season) for 2005 and 2010, from which change was estimated by visual interpretation. The optimal thresholds were defined as: lower quantile, 1 percent; upper quantile, 99 percent; and frequency (the number of data layers indicating change), 30. The resulting change mask identified areas of potential change; errors remaining in the change mask were removed by manual editing. The mask was assessed with 10m SPOT 5 HRG images for nine sites; the overall accuracy was 80 percent, with a commission error rate of 20 percent and a omission error rate of 50 percent. Map updating employs the above-described change mask, the baseline version 2 land cover map from 2005, and spectral data from the year 2010. Updating builds on the assumption that all pixels that were not identified as potential change will indicate no change between 2005 and 2010. For each class, 1,500 samples were selected from unchanged areas within 1-2 km of potential areas of change; those samples were used to train the decision tree model which was then applied to classify areas of change within the potential change mask area for the year 2010.

Included in the model were burn areas from MTBS, with an effort made to model burn severity and potential recovery. Only fires from 2010 and earlier were considered in the modeling. Areas of potential change were classified through a process similar to that used to classify the 2005 data, using a combination of MODIS composite imagery and ancillary data. Adjustments to the model were made based on experience gained in producing the 2005 Version 2 data set. Classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT). The specific DT program employed is called SEE5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). SEE5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, SEE5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. The change pixels represent a conservative estimate of change based on both spectral analysis and thematic change between land cover modeled for both 2005 and 2010.  Much of the change is in fire perimeter areas.  Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Alaska was processed separately from the conterminous United States, using DEM, SRTM,   and CADEM. The conterminous United States was processed using DEM elevation data.  Hawaii was not updated because newer data were not available. The resulting data set was checked against Landsat MRLC for quality assurance.

54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This data set replaces the 2010 edition (Edition 1.0) of the 2005 Land Cover of North America. Following the release of the first 2005 land cover data, several errors were identified in the data, including both errors in labeling and misinterpretation of thematic classes. To correct the labeling errors, each country focused on its national territory and corrected the errors which it considered most critical or misleading. For the continental data sets (including surrounding water fringe) 17440830 pixels (4.33% of the area) changed in the update. The following national counts exclude the water fringe: Canada, 10223412 pixels changed (6.44%); Mexico, 141142 pixels changed (0.45%), and U.S., 6878656 pixels changed (4.54%). The countries worked together to produce a definitive list of land cover classifications for the 2005 data; this document is available for download from the same site as the data and is entitled: North American Land Cover Classifications (2005). Version 1 of the 2005 North American Land Cover data set was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad) and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries. The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each countrys specific requirements. The data set of 2005 Land Cover of North America at a resolution of 250 meters is the first step toward this goal. The initial data set used to generate land cover information over North America was produced by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing from observations acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra). All seven land spectral bands were processed from Level 1 granules into top-of-atmosphere reflectance covering North America at a 250-meter spatial and 10-day temporal resolution. In order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by INEGI, CONABIO, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each country used specific training data and land cover mapping methodologies to create national data sets. This North America data set was produced by combining the national land cover data sets.

The continental scale land cover data generated under NALCMS can be used to address issues such as climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity loss, and changes in ecosystem structure and function, by helping users to better understand the dynamics and continental-scale patterns of North Americas changing environment. The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, the U.S. Geological Survey, or the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in the use of these data.

54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml|/metadata/dataqual/attracc/attraccr|Canada: An accuracy assessment was performed on the Canadian data at the 12-class IGBP level. To assist in tree life-form identification where crown shape was difficult to interpret, reference data were obtained through visual assessment of high- resolution image data in Google Earth, supported by Landsat data. Within the high- resolution imagery, random sampling was used to generate 838 reference samples. Each sample was interpreted and assigned a primary label, a secondary label and a confidence level. The primary label referred to the most likely class assigned to a pixel according to the interpreter, while the secondary label referred to a second class that could also be considered acceptable in cases where ambiguity existed in the interpretation or where more than one label could be deemed correct. Examples of the latter occurred mainly along transition zones where two classes occurred almost equally within a 250m pixel. The confidence level was assigned based on the ease with which the land cover was visually interpreted and on the number of classes present in the 250m pixel. A high confidence was assigned to pixels where the high-resolution Google Earth image was acquired at an appropriate time of year for the class in question (for example, summer to fall for deciduous), and where one class clearly dominated the land cover within the pixel. For the primary label only, overall accuracy was nearly 59% with a Kappa of 0.54. Overall accuracy increased to 69% and the Kappa increased to 0.65 when considering either the primary or secondary label as being correct. For primary labels interpreted with high confidence, representing 365 of 838 reference samples, overall accuracy increased again to 75% with a Kappa of 0.72. The increase in classification accuracy with high reference-data interpretation confidence was a function of greater land cover homogeneity within the reference data footprint and less ambiguity largely due to reference image quality. The analysis of the classification error matrix revealed known sources of spectral confusion among land cover classes. Adjacent forest classes tended to be confused, as well as deciduous forest, shrubland, shrub-covered wetlands, and certain croplands. These classes were difficult to separate with spectral data alone, due to all classes being primary broadleaved deciduous and the known radiometric saturation at leaf area index levels in the range of 3-5, which was achieved in all three classes. Other issues arose with the herbaceous class, which was either conifer (according to reference data along the treeline) consisting of open treed areas with herbaceous understory, or low biomass croplands. Confusion between herb, shrub, and deciduous was also due to relatively small disturbance patch sizes of cuts, primarily in British Columbia, and the point-spread function of the sensor, leading to reduced detection of objects smaller than seven pixels. Finally, the lichen/moss class was either herbaceous or wetland according to the reference data, due to the prevalence of both lichen and moss in certain wetlands and the low biomass of both the lichen/moss and herbaceous classes. A theoretical analysis of accuracy assessment of global land cover products over Canada in Latifovic and Olthof (2004) examined accuracy as a function of land cover homogeneity and thematic resolution. Based on land cover homogeneity in Canada, determined from a representative sample of medium resolution (~30m) land cover products, it was determined that a theoretical accuracy of 70-75% at a 16-land- cover-class thematic level should be achievable depending on the degree of labeling error. Accuracy for the 2005 Canadian land cover data is slightly lower when considering only the primary reference label and is in the 70% range when considering the primary or secondary label. This lower-than-theoretically- achievable accuracy is due to errors in the reference data labels as is evident from the increase in accuracy when both labels are considered. When labeling error is reduced further by considering only reference data that were interpreted with 100% confidence, the accuracy climbs to 75%. While this is on the upper range of the theoretically achievable accuracy, indicating minimal to no labeling error, it should be noted that the current assessment was done at a 12-class thematic level, which should increase the achievable accuracy and suggests that some labeling error is still present in the data set. Mexico: No formal accuracy assessment has been performed on the Mexican data, however, land cover proportions and distributions agree well with independent land cover and land use estimations of the Mapa de Vegetación y Uso de Suelo, Serie III of 2007 by INEGI. USA: No formal accuracy assessment has been performed for data products in the United States and this land cover data set should be considered provisional until a formal accuracy assessment is conducted.   During processing, the regression tree algorithm employed for land cover classification offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability.  Cross-validation provides relatively reliable estimates for land cover model performance if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design.  The cross-validation values for each zone were used to guide refinements to model training data and to improve classification results.  The quantitative value reported describes an average cross-validation value across several mapped zones and is not implied as a formal indicator of product accuracy.

Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution.

(2004) which combines the Enhanced Classification Method (ECM, Beaubien et al., 1999) and Classification by Progressive Generalization (CPG, Cihlar et al., 1998 and Latifovic et al., 1999). The principal characteristic of this classification approach is the preservation of image information and incorporation of human contextual reasoning for land cover labeling. It includes the following generalization steps: 1) initial clustering, 2) cluster agglomeration based on spectral similarity and cluster size , 3) cluster agglomeration based on thematic similarity, and 4) cluster labeling. Initial clusters were generated using the K-mean classifier with bands 1, 2, and 6 from a 2005 summer composite created by averaging composites for July and August. Several ancillary GIS layers and other land cover products over regions of Canada were consulted to refine and improve land cover labeling.

For each spectral band and the NDVI, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range between minimum and maximum were computed over the year, half-year, four-month, and quarter-year periods. This resulted in 400 metrics derived from MODIS data. In addition, ancillary data were employed including a digital elevation model and derivatives such as slope and aspect, mean, maximum and minimum temperature; total of precipitation and days with precipitation; and the number of green days. Sample data were derived from various sources, including data of the Mexican Forest Inventory, detailed cropland data, urban cover, and additional digitized points from reference sources; 20% of the samples were exclusively used for validation. The land cover type identification was achieved using a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC). C5.0 classification trees were generated for the training data. Because exclusively continuous variables were employed, the tree only contains binary splits. Boosting with ten iterations was employed. The trees were applied to the data and the confidences were computed which were used as weights for combining the individual classifications. Several classifications were generated based on combinations of 1) input data - monthly TOA reflectances, generated metrics and ancillary data; and 2) complete or subset data sets of training data. Visual and statistical assessments were carried out to obtain the final classification. A distance layer was generated based on an ecoregions map to combine results of the different classifications; only selected classifications were selected for regions where they performed better visually and statically. Finally, a water mask was superimposed; the mask was derived from the Mapa de Uso de Suelo y Vegetacion from INEGI.

The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. For North America mapping , training data were collected from several combined sources including NLCD 2001 land cover, GAP land cover, NOAA Coastal Change and Analysis land cover, LANDFIRE land cover and other data sources. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps (described in an unpublished technical document; see the USGS point of contact if additional information is needed) were required to complete the final land cover product. Finally, visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an "area of interest" (AOI); subsequently, limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI.

Urban area misclassifications included both areas where the extent was overestimated (e.g. the state of Puebla) and areas where the extent was underestimated (mainly in northern Mexico.) Areas that were mis-estimated were assigned to the most appropriate land cover class by visual interpretation; Google Earth was used for verification and visual analysis. Most water misclassifications were underestimations. It was important to correct this problem to allow for accurate change detection between this and later data sets. The waterbodies were identified on MODIS imagery and both size and shape of the areas was corrected. In addition, waterbodies that were not previously mapped were digitized where appropriate. A few waterbodies were reduced in size or eliminated but this was rare. For waterbodies that experience fluctuating water levels due to seasonal rains or to water storage and release in artificial lakes, the highest water mark, as indicated by the post-rainy season image (October), was used to map the waterbody size and shape. There were two problems with the classification of cropland. First, the definition of the cropland class is very broad and includes extensive rangeland and extensive agriculture. Second, in the Gulf Coast region cropland is spatially overestimated, but because the actual spatial patterns cannot be mapped from MODIS images, correction is difficult. As a result, cropland classifications were not modified in the version 2.

A new version of the land cover for Alaska was produced to fix the alignment problem. The land cover was remodeled using properly aligned imagery and new training data for the model. Some small areas in the extreme north and south of Alaska were missing data and these areas were added from cross-walked 2001 NLCD data and the MODIS 2010 data (it was assumed that there were land cover changes in these areas between 2005 and 2010.) The land cover information for the conterminous United States was adjusted for more accurate classification. In particular, an effort was made to improve the mapping of areas affected by fire, using the MTBS data. Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Shrub areas in the southwestern U.S. which had the wrong Level II class (Class 8 instead of Class 7) were adjusted.

The 2005-2010 Land Cover Change of North America at 250 meters was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries. The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each countrys specific requirements. This data set was created from the 2005 Land Cover of North America at 250 meters and the 2010 Land Cover of North America at 250 meters.
54a18d85e4b0bb7b6f9a1a37|54a19660e4b0bb7b6f9a1a5f.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|Information on the change in land cover across North America provided by this data set is valuable for a range of audiences, including international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme, nongovernmental conservation organizations, land managers, and scientific researchers. The continental scale land cover data generated under NALCMS can be used to address issues such as climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity loss, and changes in ecosystem structure and function, by helping users to better understand the dynamics and continental-scale patterns of North Americas changing environment. The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, the U.S. Geological Survey, or the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in the use of these data.
