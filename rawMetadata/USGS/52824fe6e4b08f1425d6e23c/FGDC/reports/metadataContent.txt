52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea278e4b08e65d60fa4ba.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This coverage contains estimates of agricultural cropping-practices in counties in the conterminous United States as reported in the 1987 Census of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1989a). Agricultural cropping-practice data are reported as either acres, or as a percentage of county area. Agricultural cropping-practice estimates were generated from surveys of all farms where $1,000 or more of agricultural products were sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. Most of the attributes summarized represent 1987 data, but some information for the 1982 Census of Agriculture also was included. The polygons representing county boundaries in the conterminous United States, as well as lakes, estuaries, and other nonland-area features were derived from the Digital Line Graph (DLG) files representing the 1:2,000,000-scale map in the National Atlas of the United States (1970). crops Agricultural cropping-practices Census of Agriculture Counties United States

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea278e4b08e65d60fa4ba.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|Procedures_Used: CENSUS DATA An automated procedure was developed for processing the raw census data into ARC/INFO coverage attributes. The procedure is summarized below: 1) copy county2m coverage to coverage representing type of census data (i.e. ag_expn or ag_land), 2) run agadd.aml for each item added to the coverage, giving coverage name and attribute field number as arguments. The agadd.aml program runs a fortran program to extract field data from the raw census data files, and then processes that raw data finally adding it as a column of attribute data to the county coverage. Other programs were developed to calculate summary statistics of the census attribute data, and to make graphics representing attribute values across the United States. COUNTY BOUNDARIES This series of maps was published as part of the National Atlas of the United States (U.S.Geological Survey, 1970). The maps for the conterminous United States were digitized in 15 sheets and published in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) format as described by Domeratz and others (1983). Each sheet was prepared by reading the DLG files of the political and water bodies layers, converting them to ARC/INFO, extracting the county boundaries and the coastline, respectively, and joining the two layers. FIPS codes were assigned to all polygons by using available sources and were checked manually. Boundaries with adjacent sheets of the 15-sheet set were edgematched manually, arbitrarily choosing one of the sheets as the "correct" border. Edgematching operations adjusted the linework as far as was necessary so that the coverages would fit to a tolerance of 100 meters. The coverage (referred to herein as Version 1.0) was stored as 49 separate coverages (48 States and the District of Columbia) because the ARC/INFO software in use at the time could not process the entire coverage. Individual States could be joined by specifying a tolerance of 100 meters. From time to time, adjustments were made to the State coverages to reflect changes in U.S. counties. It is believed the accuracy of these adjustments is comparable to the original linework. For Version 2.0, all State coverages were rejoined and manually edited to produce a perfect edgematch between all States. For States on the original map sheet boundaries, this adjustment averaged less than 20 meters and in no case was more than 100 meters. The whole coverage was CLEANed to a tolerance of 20 meters, which resulted in few, if any, effect on small offshore islands. The coverage also was checked to ensure that it represented current U.S. counties or county equivalents. The coverage in Version 1.0 stopped at the coastline. There was no attempt to depict offshore areas. This created some problems when the coverage was used to assign county codes to sampling stations located near the coast. To help in this matter, Version 2.0 includes offshore extensions of the county polygons. The (water) boundaries of many of these polygons are arbitrary. The Canadian Great Lakes features are another new addition to Version 2. They were added to improve the utility of the coverage for visual displays Although the Canadian Great Lakes are logically represented by a single polygon, practical considerations -- the inability of some software to plot polygons with a large number of vertices -- made it necessary to separate them into four polygons. The dividing lines are located in narrow channel to minimize interference with plotting patterns. Canadian islands within the Great Lakes also were included. All ticks were relocated to places that are easily visible on maps of the United States, to help in registering maps that may not otherwise have adequate registration information. To expedite accessing parts of the coverage, certain items have been indexed with the procedure, INDEX_COUNTY.AML. See Section 3 above. A spatial index also was created. When using this coverage to clip or intersect other coverages, a tolerance as low as 2 meters can be used. The processing used to derive this coverage moved boundaries from their positions on the original maps. In cases of conflicting lines, preference was given to forming the correct topology. Strictly speaking, this coverage is not identical to the source materials. These changes were unavoidable in producing a continuous coverage of the conterminous United States. Revisions made to data (revision number, date, description) COUNTY POLYGON DATA Revision 1.0, 12/17/90. This revision represents numerous corrections and minor modifications made to this set of coverages from its construction in 1985 through the revision date. Revision 2.0, 3/18/91. Major reworking of the coverage, combining all State coverages. Reviews_Applied_to_Data: The Census of Agriculture data processing procedure and attribute data have been peer reviewed in 1993 by Leonard Orzol and Barbara Ruddy, both hydrologist with the USGS. The county boundaries in this coverage have received no formal review. They have, however, been used in numerous applications where serious error would have been obvious. Some State coverages were corrected following such use. The offshore polygon extensions and the Canadian Great Lakes polygons have had no review. Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets: This coverage is part of series of 1:2,000,000-scale base maps covering the United States. Layers in this set include: COUNTY -- County boundaries. STATE -- State boundaries (formed from COUNTY). WATERBOD -- Water Bodies. STREAM -- Streams. HUC -- Hydrologic cataloging units (basins). References_Cited: Domeratz, M. A., Hallam, C. A., Schmidt, W.

The estimates were constructed from surveys of all farms where $1,000 or more of agricultural products were sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. Sampling and statistics were used to account for nonresponding farm operations. Thus, the information in the Census of Agriculture is subject to sampling variability as well as reporting and coverage errors. Census disclosure rules prevent publication of information that would disclose the operation of individual farms. Thus, for example, one or two sod farms may be reported in a county, but no acreage of sod harvested is reported, because release of that information might disclose information about a particular farmer's operation. COUNTY BOUNDARIES The original files for this map were provided in 15 sections. Boundaries near the edges of sections have been adjusted in edgematching. Polygons that extend into the water (an ocean or the Great Lakes) should be considered arbitrary.

Data are reported in either thousands of dollars, number; acres; or percent of county. Attribute names are keyed to field names found in the technical documentation of the the Census of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1989b). Specifically, the four-digit number at the end of the ARC/INFO item name matches the field-name numbers in the technical-documentation reference. Complete definitions of attributes and terms used in the census can be found in U.S. Department of Commerce (1989b; 1990). Thirty-two atributes were added to the ARC/INFO coverage of agricultural cropping-practice estimates from the 1987 Census of Agriculture. The coverage name, attribute names, and short attribute descriptions are listed in table 1. Attribute names beginning with CA represent data fields transferred directly from the census tabular data files. Attribute names beginning with PCT are percent-of-county attributes, and represent relative intensities of an agricultural practice. Attributes reported as percent of county were calculated as the attribute value (in acres) divided by the county polygon area (in acres) multiplied by 100.

For counties described by more than one polygon, attribute values are provided for each polygon and are calculated as the county total multiplied by the ratio of the area of each county polygon divided by the total area of the county. A missing-value code of -99 is used when no census-attribute data are given for a county, and for all nonland-area polygons. A missing-value code in a county land polygon could indicate any of the following condition: --agricultural practice not present in county (for example, no corn grown in county) --data withheld because of census disclosure rules --data not available to census --data not published because county contains less than 10 farms --data not applicable COUNTY POLYGON ATTRIBUTES Each county is identified by a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code. The first two digits represent the state and the three remaining represent the county within State. County names (in upper case) and the two-character State abbreviation also are included. All polygons are coded by polygon type (PLYTYPE) as follows: 0 = U.S. land. 1 = Extensions of counties into the ocean and estuaries. Some boundaries may be arbitrary. 2 = U.S. Great Lakes. Some boundaries between counties may be arbitrary. 3 = Canadian Great Lakes. 4 = Canadian islands in Great Lakes, included for visual cartographic purposes. 9 = External polygon. All arcs are coded by boundary type (BNDTYPE) as follows: 0 = Coastline of United States. 1 = State-State border occurring on land. 2 = County-county border, within state, occurring on land. 3 = State-State border occurring on the ocean, an estuary, or a Great Lake. Some of these borders are arbitrary. 4 = County-county border, with State, but occurring on the ocean, an estuary, or a Great Lake. Some of these borders are arbitrary. 5 = International border occurring on land. 6 = International border occurring on water. 7 = Canadian shoreline of the Great Lakes. 8 = Arbitrary separation line between the Canadian portions of the Great Lakes. 9 = Closure line with the external polygon. This is arbitrary. All BNDTYPE values are determined from the adjoining polygons by the routine, INDEX_COUNTY.AML. The coverage is indexed (ARC: INDEXITEM) on FIPS code, State FIPS code, State abbreviation, county name, polygon type, and boundary type.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea279e4b08e65d60fa4db.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This dataset is a coverage of the physiographic provinces, aquifer outcrops and recharge rates for Tennessee. Each polygon is attributed with its associated physiographic region name (Miller, 1974), aquifer type and composition (Connell and Barron, 1993, p. 2), and aquifer recharge rates (Hoos, 1990 p. 19).
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea279e4b08e65d60fa4db.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|The dataset was created to make generalizations about an aquifer's capabilities of transport and recharge and to give names to those regions.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea279e4b08e65d60fa4db.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|Procedures_Used: The linework was constructed by digitizing a map, prepared by Bradley and Hollyday (1985), at a scale of 1:1,000,000. At the request of State officials, aquifer boundaries in the West Tennessee area were modified to reflect work reported by Parks and others (1982). The coverage was created for the publication by Connell and Barron (1993). The coverage was validated and attributed with physiographic names and aquifer recharge rates in 1997-98. Revisions: 03/15/97 - Coverage was found valid, and attributed with physiographic names 04/03/98 - Aquifer recharge rates were attributed Reviews_Applied_to_Data: The dataset was reviewed by several Tennessee District personnel and was deemed a valid dataset for use at the documented scale.

The U.S. Geological Survey constructed a water-table map of the Mojave River, the Morongo and the Fort Irwin Ground-Water Basins for ground-water levels measured during the period January-September 1996. Water-level data were collected from 632 wells to construct the contours. The water-table contours were digitized from the paper map which was published at a scale of 1:175,512. The contour interval ranges from 3,400 to 1,550 feet above sea level.

Mendez and Allen H. Christensen, U.S. Geological Survey WRIR 97-4160, and make the data available for use with geographic information systems.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea283e4b08e65d60fa573.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|The Mojave River, the Morongo and the Fort Irwin Ground-Water Basins are in the Mojave Desert region. The rapid growth in population in these basins, which is due, in part, to their proximity to Los Angeles, has increased the demand for water. Increased pumping to meet the needs of an increasing resident population has resulted in ground-water overdraft in parts of the ground-water basin (Mendez and Christensen 1997).

The delineation of the buried valleys was included as part of the surficial geology map (figure 5) created by Howells (1982). The digital data were produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Figure 5 in Howells (1982) was scanned and digitized on-screen to create this coverage. See cross reference information for more detail. According to the map credit for figure 5, the geology for Sioux County was based on soil maps prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (1959), data collected by Randich (1975), and a geologic map by Carlson (1978). The geology for Corson County was based on soil maps prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (1959) and unpublished maps of the U.S Soil Conservation Service, modified by test drilling and field reconnaissance.

STEP 1: The map was scanned by the South Dakota Geological Survey and the image file was sent to the USGS on a CD. STEP 2: The image file was registered using 22 points with an rms of 78.1 meters. A new rectified image file was created with a cell size of 22.7 meters using the nearest neighbor option. STEP 3: An arc coverage was created by digitizing on-screen using the rectified image file as the background.

Information from the rock-samples is summarized for each hole and includes lithologic descriptions, physical and mechanical properties, fracture characteristics, and hydraulic properties where holes were completed below the water table. The digital data are accessed from the webpage for the NTS U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Core Library and Data Center, Mercury, Nevada. Links to additional information, such as water-level data from the National Water Inventory System (NWIS), and USGS borehole graphical information are included for some holes.

Each hole has a summary of rock-sample information from 5 spreadsheets (rock samples, lithologic descriptions, rock properties, fracture characteristics, and hydraulic properties), and the total interval (depths) samples were obtained from. Additional links to USGS water-level charts and borehole graphics are provided where available.

Custom macros were developed by USGS staff to extract and summarize the type of information (core, lithologic, etc.) available, and the total interval sampled within each hole. The summarized information was then used to construct a geospatial layer in ArcGIS. New attribute fields containing hyperlinks to additional information not found in the Mercury Core Library, such as water level or borehole graphics, were added where appropriate.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea286e4b08e65d60fa5f5.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This dataset consists of a personal geodatabase containing several vector datasets. This database contains the information needed to link the HUCs together so a watershed may be delineated that spans more than one 8-digit HUC. These datasets may be used with the ArcHydro Tools, developed by ESRI in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey, StreamStats Development Team. The datasets, together with the ArcHydro Tools and the ArcHydro 8-digit HUC datasets for an area of interest, allow users to delineate watersheds and compute several watershed characteristics.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea286e4b08e65d60fa5f5.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|These datasets were produced to support the Idaho StreamStats application, as well as to develop a model of perennial streams in Idaho.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea286e4b08e65d60fa5f5.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|The personal geodatabase contains the following feature classes: huc_net_Junctions Default junction feature class for geometric network. Empty of features because all needed points are in Point3D. HUCLongestFlowPath Precomputed longest flow path for HUC. hucpoly Polygon feature class containing one polygon for each local huc-based workspace. Serves as a spatial index to huc datasets. Point3D 3D points used to create junctions in the global geometric network. Streams3D 3D streams used in geometric network that connects hucpoly polygons. In addition, the geodatabase contains a 3D geometric network composed of Streams3D, Point3D, and huc_net_Junctions. The geodatabase also contains the HUCHasJunction relationship class, which relates the hucpoly features to the Point3D features via the JunctionID. HucPeakFlowRegions and HucLowFlowRegions are tables containing region area breakdowns for each hucpoly for the peak flow and low flow regions, respectively. The HYDROIDTABLE and LAYERKEYTABLE are used by the ArcHydro Tools to track and assign HydroIDs. To use these data with the ArcHydro Tools, users also need to download the ds412_StatewideLayers.zip file, plus the zip files for any ArcHydro 8-digit HUC datasets that overlap their area of interest. The ArcHydro 8-digit HUC datasets needed may be determined by overlaying the user's area of interest with the "hucpoly" polygon feature class in this global geodatabase. The ArcHydro 8-digit HUC datasets are needed only for the area within which it is desired to delienate watersheds. Upstream ArcHydro 8-digit HUC datasets are not needed. A new folder should be established and all zip files should be extracted into this folder. Use of this procedure will ensure that the datasets are in their proper locations relative to one another. A fresh ArcMap document (identified by the ".MXD" file extension) should be created by starting ArcMap, loading the "Layers" feature dataset (including all its component feature classes) from the global.mdb file, and saving the document with a new file name. The ArcHydro Tools use configuration information stored in Extensible Markup Language (XML) to define basin characteristics and other configuration options. XML code for the Idaho StreamStats configuration has been provided to ESRI and incorporated into versions of the ArcHydro Tools released after February 1, 2009. The ArcHydro Tools ApUtilities->Additional Utilities->Configure Function Parameters tool may be used to load the configuration for StreamStats, using the configuration named "Idaho_10m". This will load the XML configuration designed to work with these data. The Local Point Delineation or Global Point Delineation tools from the ArcHydro Tools may be used to delineate watersheds. The Compute Local Parameters or Compute Global Parameters menu options may then be used to compute watershed characteristics. For further explanation of the functions of the above datasets, and for instructions on using the tools, see the ArcHydro Tools documentation.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea287e4b08e65d60fa609.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This data layer contains groundwater contributing areas for streams, ponds and estuaries in the Cape Cod and the Plymouth-Carver region. Contributing areas were delineated by using regional groundwater-flow models. The percent impervious cover of each contributing area was calculated by using a statewide 1-m resolution binary rater data layer of impervious surface in2005. This is one of three data layers in this data series publication.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea287e4b08e65d60fa609.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This data layer was created in cooperation with the Evironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assist local communities in environmental planning and stormwater run off studies. The purpose of this data layer is to provide basin boundaries and impervious surface data at a more discretized scale than is available with current Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) subdivisions.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea287e4b08e65d60fa609.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|The hydrology of the Cape Cod and Plymouth- Carver Regions of Massachusetts is dominated by groundwater flow. Basins in these areas cannot be delineated by surface topography, but are instead defined by groundwater elevation and flow direction. Regional groundwater models of the Plymouth Carver aquifer (Masterson and others,2009) and Cape Cod aquifer system (Walter and Whealan, 2005) were used to delineate groundwater contributing areas in cooperation with Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection as part of the Massachusetts Estuaries Project (Walter et al 2004). Groundwater flow was simulated by the three-dimensional finite-difference groundwater model MODFLOW-2000 (Harbaugh and others, 2000) and the particle tracking program MODPATH4 (Pollock, 2000). Basin boundary delineations reflect long-term average hydrologic conditions with public-supply wells pumping at average withdrawal rates for 1995 to 2000. The original delineation coverage included groundwater contributing areas for 593 estuaries, ponds, streams, and wells on Cape Cod. For this new layer, contributing-area polygons for individual sub-estuaries and small flow-through ponds were merged and dissolved into larger contributing area polygons for major streams and estuarine systems. In the Plymouth-Carver Region, contributing areas were delineated for 10 freshwater streams. In addition to stream basins, contributing areas were delineated for direct drainage into the Cape Cod Canal, Buzzards Bay, and Cape Cod Bay. Contributing areas for individual estuaries in the Plymouth - Carver region were not available. Individual polygon areas were modified by using ArcGIS 9.3 editing tools to eliminate small gaps or overlapping sliver polygons resulting from the spatial discretization of the model. Boundaries were not smoothed and thus contain jagged stair-step edges which are an artifact of the grid spacing of the groundwater model. The percent impervious cover was calculated for each hydrologic unit. Two gridded impervious surface datasets are available for Massachusetts. The National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) is derived from Landsat satellite imagery and provides percent impervious surface on 30-m grid cells for the entire United States for the year 2001 (http://www.mrlc.gov/index.php). Another impervious surface data layer is provided by the Massachusetts Office of Geographic and Environmental Information (MassGIS), (http://www.mass.gov/mgis/laylist.htm). This data is a 1-m binary impervious surface grid based on 2005 infrared orthoimagery for the state of Massachusetts. To compare the datasets, both the MassGIS and the NLCD grids were overlayed onto hydrologic unit polygons. Percent impervious in each hydrologic unit was calculated using both impervious surface data layers. Although the data from both sources are comparable, there are notable differences between the data sets, particularly at the high and low ends of the impervious scale. The MassGIS data is preferred to the NLCD data because it is more recent and is at a finer spatial scale. However it cannot be used for basins which extend past the border of MA. Using only data from hydrologic units falling entirely within MA, a regression equation was developed relating the percent impervious surface as calculated with the 1-m MassGIS impervious data layer to the 30-m NLCD data layer. Natural log transformations were used to linearize the relationship. Results of the regression analysis are shown below. The regression equation was calculated with 1283 independent data points. The R2 for the regression is 93.9% and regression coefficients were significantly different from zero at the 0.05 significance level. Ln (Imp_1m) = 1.15 + 0.601 * Ln (Imp_30m) Where, Imp_1m = percent impervious for a hydrologic unit calculated with 1-m MassGIS impervious grid Imp_30m = percent impervious for a hydrologic unit calculated with 30-m NLCD impervious grid For hydrologic units with area outside of MA, percent impervious was calculated with the NLCD grid and then transformed using the above relationship.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea28ee4b08e65d60fa63d.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This dataset was collected with a PLGR government-issue GPS, and through manual measurement in the field. Points were gathered while canoeing along the North Fork Shenandoah River. Each location marked a change in meso-scale habitat type. GPS points were supplemented with GIS-derived points in areas where manual measurements were made. The points were used to generate a line coverage. This coverage represents physical habitat at a meso-scale (width of stream).

This dataset is intended to be used with the following two tabular dBase files: http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?ds573_tillage_lu92e and http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?ds573_tillage_lu01. The two tabular datasets contain the Tillage Practices in the Conterminous United States, 1989-2004---Datasets Aggregated by Watershed. This dataset and the two tabular datasets can be linked using the common attribute HUC8_N. Information about how the tabular data and geospatial data can be related are given in the data series report: http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/ds573/ .The original dataset is the 12-digit Subwatershed boundaries (WBD_archive_17nov2009_9.2_file). The 12-digit boundaries were dissolved to 8-digit boundaries to be used with the two tabular .dbase data files containing the tillage practice data for the United States. ORIGINAL METADATA: This data set is a complete digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the entire United States. This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the "Federal Guidelines, Requirements, and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset; Chapter 3 of Section A, Federal Standards, Book 11, Collection and Delineation of Spatial Data; Techniques and Methods 11-A3" (04/01/2009). http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/watershed/index.html . Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 4th level sub-basins, 5th level watersheds, 6th level subwatersheds, name, size, downstream hydrologic unit, type of watershed, non-contributing areas and flow modification.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea28fe4b08e65d60fa655.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|The Watershed and Subwatershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. The smaller sized 6th level sub-watersheds (up to 250,000 acres) are useful for numerous application programs supported by a variety of local, State, and Federal Agencies. This data set is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. The dataset is seamless and, for the most part, a nationally consistant geospatial database.

Data completeness for DRG files reflects content of the source graphic and may therefore be reflected in the completeness and accuracy of the WBD. The map was digitized from USGS 1:24,000-scale digital raster graphic base maps, with an inherited error of +/- 40 feet according to the USGS National Map Accuracy Standards. It is estimated that any errors detected were less than 10%. It should also be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used (i.e. natural water flow is downhill), the locations of boundaries is still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale DRG's do not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries.

Hydrologic Units that were under 10,000 acres (for the 12-digit units) and 40,000 acres (for the 10-digit units) were reviewed and if possible were dissolved out. Along the coastal areas classic watersheds that fell within the federal guidelines size criteria (12-digit: 10,000-40,000 acres, 10-digit: 40,000-250,000 acres) were broken out. If possible the remaining frontals were left as their own units. Frontals that did not meet the size criteria were grouped together with other frontals within the overall 8-digit or 10-digit unit. Hydrologic units what were greater than 40,000 acres (12-digit units) and 250,000 acres (10-digit units) were reviewed. If possible these unit where then broken down into smaller units that met the size criteria. In some cases additional breaks within the unit would not have made sense or have been very useful (example: When the majority of the unit was made up by a major waterbody feature such as a lake or reservoir and the surrounding tributaries were too small to break out as their own unit). In these instances the unit was left big. Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: USGSDRG

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea28fe4b08e65d60fa695.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|Estimates of area and aerial extent of land use categories are an essential component for computing the water budget of the High Plains aquifer. These raster land-use/land-cover data represent yearly simulated future land-use/land-cover for the High Plains from 2009 to 2050. These data were developed using the FOREcasting SCEnarios (FORE-SCE) of future land cover model (Sohl and others, 2007; Sohl and Sayler 2008) for two (A2 and B2) of the four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate scenarios and then processed using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The GIS software used to process these data was Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI, Inc.) ArcGIS Desktop 10.0.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea28fe4b08e65d60fa695.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|The purpose of these raster data are for use as input to a Soil Water Balance Model (SWB). SWB uses topography, soil properties, and land use to simulate recharge rates and groundwater withdrawals (irrigation pumpage). The simulated recharge rates were then used in a groundwater-flow model.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea28fe4b08e65d60fa695.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|This geodatabase contains 42 rasters organized by year. The naming convention for the rasters in this geodatabase is "flulc_b2_xxxx" where xxxx represents the year from 2009 to 2050 (for example flulc_b2_2020 is the predicted land-use raster for 2020).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea28fe4b08e65d60fa695.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc|Predicted (forecasted) land-use/land-cover(LULC) data for the area overlying the High Plains aquifer from 2009-2050 was constructed using the FORE-SCE (FOREcasting SCEnarios of future land cover) model (Sohl and others, 2007; Sohl and Sayler, 2008). Future scenarios were developed using characteristics and assumptions consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) storylines A2 and B2 (Nakicenovic and others, 2000) and historical data from the USGS Land Cover Trends project (Loveland and others, 2002). A Protected Areas Database for the United States (U.S. Geological Survey, 2010) was used to restrict LULC change on currently protected public lands. Starting LULC was based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2008 Cropland Data Layer(CDL) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2008). The CDL was collapsed into the following 18 classes; corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, wheat and small grains, alfalfa/hay, other crops, fallow, open water, developed, barren, deciduous forest, mixed forest, evergreen forest, shrubland, grassland, woody wetland, herbaceous wetland, and perennial ice/snow. Probability surfaces for each LULC were developed using logistic regression to analyze relationships between LULC distributions and drivers. Individual patches of LULC change were then placed on the landscape in an iterative modeling procedures until the scenario-prescribed proportions of LULC change for a given year were met, with patch characteristics determined by historical regional trends and scenario storylines. Spatial modeling of the two scenarios provided spatial patterns of land-use change consistent with underlying assumptions and processes associated with each scenario. The economically oriented scenario (A2) was characterized by loss of natural land covers and expansion of agricultural and urban land uses. The environmentally oriented scenario (B2) experienced declines in agriculture and slight increases in natural land covers.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea290e4b08e65d60fa6b5.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The water-budget components geodatabase contains selected data from maps in the, "Selected Approaches to Estimate Water-Budget Components of the High Plains, 1940 through 1949 and 2000 through 2009" report (Stanton and others, 2011). Data were collected and synthesized from existing climate models including the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) (Daly and others, 1994), and the Snow accumulation and ablation model (SNOW-17) (Anderson, 2006), and used in soil-water balance models to compute various components of a water budget. The methodologies used to compute the averages and volumes for the data in this geodatabase are slightly different for different components and models.

The irrigation data for SOWAT were then summarized annually by region and state using a zone-budget routine within the SOWAT software package. The zone layers were created by making zone masks from the boundaries of the High Plains aquifer regions (northern High Plains, central High Plains, and southern High Plains) and from the individual state regions within the High Plains boundary. The zone layers included the areas of NODATA where the aquifer is not present within the boundary of the High Plains.

This dataset contains point vector data from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHD+) 1:100,000 stream polyline data converted into points and attributed with elevation values in feet above sea level.Streams were initially included if they had a mean estimated base flow of more than 10 cubic feet per second (based on streamflow data from long-term streamflow-gaging stations operated by the USGS or the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources). The stream network then was expanded to include selected streams that were deemed hydrogeologically important but had a mean estimated base flow of less than 10 cubic feet per second.

Streams were initially included if they had a mean estimated base flow of more than 10 cubic feet per second (based on streamflow data from long-term streamflow-gaging stations operated by the USGS (U.S. Geological Survey, 2012) or the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources (Nebraska Department of Natural Resources, 2012). The stream network then was expanded to include selected streams that were deemed hydrogeologically important but had a mean estimated base flow of less than 10 cubic feet per second. The feature was attributed with the mfrowcol identifier of the NHP groundwater-flow model cell grid feature class.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea29ae4b08e65d60fa6fd.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This coverage was derived from U.S. Geological Survey National Elevation Dataset (NED) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for all of Ohio and portions of Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. The dataset is a raster grid coverage representing a 30 meter grid cell size, or 1-arc second, and is in units of decimeters. The various NED source datasets used to create this dataset came primarily from state agencies who provide such data free of any fees or charges. More information about NED data can be found at http://gisdata.usgs.net/NED/default.asp.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea29ae4b08e65d60fa6fd.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This coverage was created to derive elevation and hydrography related characteristics of selected drainage basins within Ohio and portions of surrounding states for use in regression equations present by Koltun (2003). These characteristics include mean basin elevation, elevation at basin centroid, and main-channel slope. Other hydrography related uses of DEMs include the analysis of aspect, hill shade, flow accumulation, and flow direction. DEMs of 30 meter resolution are intended to be used at scales of 1:24,000 and smaller.

Responsibility for construction of the spacecraft and instrument lies with NASA. The Landsat Program is part of NASA's Earth Observing System global change initiative administered by NASA's Earth Science Enterprise. Data processing, archiving, and distribution are performed by the USGS. The primary ground station, the data handling facility and archive are located at the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) in Sioux Falls, SD. NASA managed flight operations from the control center at the Goddard Space Flight Center until October 1, 2000, at which time responsibility for flight operations transferred to the USGS. The ground system is able to distribute raw ETM+ data within 24 hours of its reception at the EROS.

The Modular Multi-Satellite Preprocessor (MMSP) receives the serial TM-A (radiometrically corrected) or TM-R (radiometrically and geometrically corrected) data from the DCRSi cassette drive. Data resampling begins after the completion of satellite orbit model generation/refinement and radiometric calibration. Data resampling consists of three distinct components; coarse resampling table generation, resampling table densification, and two-dimensional convolution resampling. Coarse table generation consists of calculating relationships between product line/pixel values at a set of grid-points and the corresponding line/pixel values in the raw data. Table densification consists of interpolating similar relationships between the remaining product line/pixel values and the corresponding raw data line/pixel values. Table densification also includes performing a number of corrections to the interpolation to account for various inaccuracies in the raw data.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2a8e4b08e65d60fa827.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|Introduction The hydrographic area (HA) boundaries for the State of Nevada were delineated on 1:250,000-scale maps, in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and then redrawn and published at 1:500,000-scale (Cardinalli and others, 1968). This 1:500,000-scale map is the current reference for HAs in Nevada and is used as a guide in delineating the HAs at 1:24,000-scale. This data set contains the topographic and administrative HA boundaries for the Humboldt River Basin. The Humboldt River Basin HAs were delineated and digitized from 1993 to 1998 using 1:24,000-scale USGS topographic maps. Reviews The digital data in this data base has gone through a rigorous, multi-level, quality-control process that ensures the data set is a fair representation of the source map. If errors are encountered in this data set, it will be appreciated if the user would pass this information to the Metadata_Contact. Two reviews were done. The reviewers were asked to check metadata and other documentation files for completeness and accuracy. Reviewers were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances, projections, and geographic extent.

Notes It should be noted that, although the boundary lines between hydrographic areas generally coincide with true topographic basin divides, some of the lines are arbitrary divisions that have no basis in topography, but are administrative and specified by Nevada Division of Water Resources.

The HA boundaries were delineated on 1:24,000-scale U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps using topographic contour lines and hydrographic features (Cartier and others, 1994). 2. The topographic HA boundaries were verified by two Hydrologists and the administrative HA boundaries were verified by the NDWR. 3. The HA boundaries were digitized directly into UTM, Zone 11 from the topographic maps with an RMS of at the most 0.007. 4. Positional and attribute accuracy were verified. 5. Polygon topology was built using the Arc/INFO(R) CLEAN command with the fuzzy tolerance = 0.001 and dangle = 0.01.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2c6e4b08e65d60fa8cf.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This dataset is a map of land use and vegetation for the Island of Maui, Hawaii, circa 2010. This dataset is a modified version of the U.S. Geological Survey LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type map (LANDFIRE.HI_110EVT, Refresh 2008) for the Island of Maui, Hawaii. The LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type map was modified to create this map of land use and vegetation for use in a water-budget model. Modifications included converting the LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type map from a raster to a shapefile format, assigning land-use names, and adding golf-course and crop boundaries.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2c6e4b08e65d60fa8cf.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This dataset was developed for use in a water-budget model that computes groundwater recharge, fog drip, irrigation, evapotranspiration, and runoff.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2c7e4b08e65d60fa8e7.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This is a polygon coverage of the Land Resource Regions and Major Land Resource Areas of the conterminous United States. Land resource regions are geographic areas that are characterized by a particular pattern of soils, climate, water resources and land uses. (USDA, Soil Conservation Service, 1981). Major land resource areas are subregions of the land resource regions and comprise smaller homogeneous areas. The scale of this coverage is 1:2,000,000. Note: The Soil Conservation Service now (1995) is called the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Descriptors: Land Resource Regions Major Land Resource Areas United States
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2c7e4b08e65d60fa8e7.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|The primary use of this coverage is for regional and national display rather than specific local data analysis due to the small scale (1:2,000,000) of this coverage.

Eros Data Center received the digital data files from U.S. Soil Conservation Service, where it was automated from a 1:2,000,000 scale map. A copy of this map, ("Land Resource Regions and Major Land Resource Areas of the United States") is furnished with Agriculture Handbook 296, and is published at a scale of 1:7,500,000. It was first published in 1981, with information current as of 1978. The map was further revised as of January 1, 1984, and is the basis for the digital version of the map. (Bliss, 1989) The map was compiled and digitized at a scale of 1:2,000,000 in the Albers Equal-Area Projection having the following parameters: First parallel: 29 30 00 N Second parallel: 45 30 00 N Central meridian -96 00 00 W Latitude of projection origin: 23 00 00 N False easting: 0.0 False northing: 0.0 Revisions: 1.1 12/91 Enhanced the polygon attribute table. It now includes names of Land Resource Regions and Major Land Resource Areas. Reviews_Applied_to_Data: Has not been reviewed.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2e7e4b08e65d60faa10.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This data set represents the 30-year (1971-2000) average annual precipitation in millimeters multiplied by 100 compiled for every catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States. The source data were the "United States Average Monthly or Annual Precipitation, 1971 - 2000" raster dataset produced by the PRISM Group at Oregon State University. The NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial datasets that incorporates many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first widely used in New England, and thus referred to as "the New England Method." This technique involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building "walls" using the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. Over the past two years, an interdisciplinary team from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, found that this method produces the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized by 18 Production Units that cover the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus version 1.1 data are grouped by the U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1, covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 3 and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper. MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific Northwest River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 18.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2e7e4b08e65d60faa10.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This spatial data set was created and used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) specifically to estimate the 30-year (1971-2000) average annual precipitation in millimeters multiplied by 100 per watershed segment in the application of the national SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model. The SPARROW model relates in-stream water-quality measurements to spatially referenced characteristics of watersheds, including contaminant sources and factors influencing terrestrial and stream transport. The model empirically estimates the origin and fate of contaminants in streams, and quantifies uncertainties in these estimates based on model coefficient error and unexplained variability in the observed data. For more information on the USGS SPARROW model please refer to: http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/sparrow/intro/intro.html

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2e9e4b08e65d60faa4c.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This coverage contains estimates of nitrogen-fertilizer sales for the conterminous United States in 1990 as reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1990) and by Jerald Fletcher (West Virginia University, written commun., 1992). Nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates in this coverage are reported for each county polygon in tons of actual nutrient sold (inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, and potash) as distinct from total tons of fertilizer product. The data are summarized for fertilizer years (i.e. the 1987 fertilizer year runs from July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987). The polygons representing county boundaries in the conterminous United States, as well as lakes, estuaries, and other nonland-area features were derived from the Digital Line Graph (DLG) file representing the 1:2,000,000-scale map in the National Atlas of the United States (1970).

The procedure is summarized bellow: 1) copy raw data to file called nit.temp and edit off header records, 2) run script nitdat.sc making file called nit.in 3) edit nit.in removing extra column between state and county FIPS codes, and extra lines at end of file ("00000" FIPS), 4) rename nit.in nit%year%.inp 5) copy county2m coverage to coverage called nit%year% 6) run nitadd.aml COUNTY BOUNDARIES This series of maps was published as part of the National Atlas of the United States (U.S.Geological Survey, 1970). The maps for the conterminou United States were digitized in 15 sheets and published in the Digital Lin Graph (DLG) format as described by Domeratz and others (1983). Each sheet was prepared by reading the DLG files of the political and water bodies layers, converting them to ARC/INFO, extracting the county boundaries and the coastline, respectively, and joining the two layers. FIPS codes were assigned to all polygons by using available sources and were checked manually. Boundaries with adjacent sheets of the 15-sheet set were edgematched manually, arbitrarily choosing one of the sheets as the "correct" border. Edgematching operations adjusted the linework as far as was necessary so that the coverages would fit to a tolerance of 100 meters. The coverage (referred to herein as Version 1.0) was stored as 49 separate coverages (48 States and the District of Columbia) because the ARC/INFO software in use at the time could not process the entire coverage. Individual States could be joined by specifying a tolerance of 100 meters. From time to time, adjustments were made to the State coverages to reflect changes in U.S. counties. It is believed the accuracy of these adjustments is comparable to the original linework. For Version 2.0, all State coverages were rejoined and manually edited to produce a perfect edgematch between all States. For States on the original map sheet boundaries, this adjustment averaged less than 20 meters and in no case was more than 100 meters. The whole coverage was CLEANed to a tolerance of 20 meters, which resulted in few, if any, effect on small offshore islands. The coverage also was checked to ensure that it represented current U.S. counties or county equivalents. The coverage in Version 1.0 stopped at the coastline. There was no attempt to depict offshore areas. This created some problems when the coverage was used to assign county codes to sampling stations located near the coast. To help in this matter, Version 2.0 includes offshore extensions of the county polygons. The (water) boundaries of many of these polygons are arbitrary. The Canadian Great Lakes features are another new addition to Version 2. They were added to improve the utility of the coverage for visual displays Although the Canadian Great Lakes are logically represented by a single polygon, practical considerations -- the inability of some software to plo polygons with a large number of vertices -- made it necessary to separate them into four polygons. The dividing lines are located in narrow channel to minimize interference with plotting patterns. Canadian islands within the Great Lakes also were included. All ticks were relocated to places that are easily visible on maps of the United States, to help in registering maps that may not otherwise have adequate registration information. To expedite accessing parts of the coverage, certain items have been indexed with the procedure, INDEX_COUNTY.AML. See Section 3 above. A spatial index also was created. When using this coverage to clip or intersect other coverages, a tolerance as low as 2 meters can be used. The processing used to derive this coverage moved boundaries from their positions on the original maps. In cases of conflicting lines, preference was given to forming the correct topology. Strictly speaking, this coverag is not identical to the source materials. These changes were unavoidable in producing a continuous coverage of the conterminous United States. Revisions: COUNTY POLYGON DATA Revision 1.0, 12/17/90. This revision represents numerous corrections and minor modifications made to this set of coverages from its construction in 1985 through the revision date. Revision 2.0, 3/18/91. Major reworking of the coverage, combining all State coverages. Reviews_Applied_to_Data: The fertilizer-sales data processing procedure and attribute data have been peer reviewed in 1993 by Leonard Orzol and Barbara Ruddy, both hydrologist with the USGS. The county boundaries in this coverage have received no formal review. They have, however, been used in numerous applications where serious error would have been obvious. Some State coverages were corrected following such use. The offshore polygon extensions and the Canadian Great Lakes polygons have had no review.

In some counties no fertilizer sales were reported, but some fertilize use was reported in the Census Data. Although fertilizer expenditures estimates (in $1,000) represent the 1987 growing year, the nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates (tons) generally reflect 1990 amounts. Estimates of nitrogen-fertilizer sales by county were constructed from a combination of data reported to State regulatory agencies and from data in the 1987 Census of Agriculture. Fertilizer-sales data submitted annually to State regulatory agencies by fertilizer dealers reflect total sales without regard to the land use for which it was bought, or the State (or county) in which the fertilizer was actually used. In the Census of Agriculture sampling and statistics were used to account for nonresponding farm operations (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1989b). Thus, the information that describes county-level fertilizer sales is subject to sampling variability as well as reporting and coverage errors. Census disclosure rules also prevent the publication of information that would reveal the operation of individual farms. COUNTY BOUNDARIES The original files for this map were provided in 15 sections. Boundaries near the edges of sections have been adjusted in edgematching. Polygons that extend into the water (an ocean or the Great Lakes) should be considered arbitrary.

This is different from horizontal resolution as reported in the DOC file. Positional accuracy defines how correctly the digital features match real-world features and woiuld be related to the concept of the National Map Accuracy Standard -- xx% of well-defined point features fall within xx units of their true position. The resolution is the smallest unit of measure the GIS can reliably manage without truncation or rounding.)

The data are summarized for fertilizer years (i.e. the 1987 fertilizer year runs from July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987). Nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates by county were constructed from estimates reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1990) for 1985-89 and by Jerald Fletcher (West Virginia University, written commun., 1992) for 1990-91. The estimates are provided for seven years (1985-91) in seven ARC/INFO coverages (NIT85, NIT86, NIT87, NIT88, NIT89, NIT90, and NIT91); however, the 1987 Census of Agriculture data on fertilizer expenditures used to disaggregate State sales totals to county-level sales estimates represents only 1987 sales. Eleven attributes were added to an ARC/INFO coverage for each year of fertilizer-sales data. All attribute names contain a number that represents the year of the data. For example, NTOT86 is the attribute name for total nitrogen-fertilizer sales in 1986. Sales estimates are provided for total nitrogen, potash, and phosphate, and for nitrogen sold as ammonium nitrate, anhydrous ammonia, miscellaneous forms, nitrogen solutions, and urea. Example nitrogen-fertilizer sales coverage names, attribute names, and short attribute definitions are listed in table 1. Table 1. Nitrogen-fertilizer sales, 1990 coverage name, attribute names, and short attribute descriptions __________________________________________________________________________ NIT90--Coverage of nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates, 1990 __________________________________________________________________________ Attribute name Description __________________________________________________________________________ NTOT90 Total estimated nitrogen-fertilizer sales, 1990 (tons) NTOT90.USE Rate of nitrogen-fertilizer use in county polygon (tons per square mile) K2090 Estimated potash sales, 1990 (tons) K2090.USE Rate of potash use in county polygon (tons per square mile P20590 Estimated phosphate sales, 1990 (tons) P20590.USE Rate of phosphate use in county polygon (tons per square mile) AMNI90 Fertilizer sold as ammonium nitrate, 1990 (tons) ANHY90 Fertilizer sold as anhydrous ammonia, 1990 (tons) NMIS90 Fertilizer sold as miscellaneous forms, 1990 (tons) NSOL90 Fertilizer sold as nitrogen solutions, 1990 (tons) UREA90 Fertilizer sold as urea, 1990 (tons) __________________________________________________________________________ Nitrogen-fertilizer sales estimates in counties represented by one polygon are equal to county totals. For counties described by more than one polygon, attribute values are provided for each polygon and are calculated as the county total multiplied by the ratio of the area of each county polygon divided by the total area of the county. A missing-value code of -99.00 is used when no fertilizer-sales attribut data are given for a county and for all nonland-area polygons. The missing-value code can indicate any of the following conditions: --fertilizer not sold in the county, --crop data withheld because of census disclosure rules, --crop data not available to the census, or --crop data not published because county contains fewer than 10 farms. COUNTY POLYGON ATTRIBUTES Each county is identified by a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code. The first two digits represent the state and the three remaining represent the county within State. County names (in upper case) and the two-character State abbreviation also are included. All polygons are coded by polygon type (PLYTYPE) as follows: 0 = U.S. land. 1 = Extensions of counties into the ocean and estuaries. Some boundaries may be arbitrary. 2 = U.S. Great Lakes. Some boundaries between counties may be arbitrary. 3 = Canadian Great Lakes. 4 = Canadian islands in Great Lakes, included for visual cartographic purposes. 9 = External polygon. All arcs are coded by boundary type (BNDTYPE) as follows: 0 = Coastline of United States. 1 = State-State border occurring on land. 2 = County-county border, within state, occurring on land. 3 = State-State border occurring on the ocean, an estuary, or a Great Lake. Some of these borders are arbitrary. 4 = County-county border, with State, but occurring on the ocean, an estuary, or a Great Lake. Some of these borders are arbitrary. 5 = International border occurring on land. 6 = International border occurring on water. 7 = Canadian shoreline of the Great Lakes. 8 = Arbitrary separation line between the Canadian portions of the Great Lakes. 9 = Closure line with the external polygon. This is arbitrary. All BNDTYPE values are determined from the adjoining polygons by the routine, INDEX_COUNTY.AML. The coverage is indexed (ARC: INDEXITEM) on FIPS code, State FIPS code, State abbreviation, county name, polygon type, and boundary type.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f4e4b08e65d60faa92.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This data set represents the estimated percentage of the 1-km grid cell that is covered by or subject to the agricultural conservation practice (CP447), Irrigation System by Tailwater Recovery (ISTR) on agricultural land by county. Irrigation System by Tailwater Recovery is described as "a planned irrigation system in which all facilities utilized for the collection, storage, and transportation of irrigation tailwater for reuse have been installed." (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995) Tailwater is the area immediately below a dam where the river water is cooler than normal and rich in nutrients. This data set was created with geographic information systems (GIS) and database management tools. The acres on which ISTR's are applied were totaled at the county level in the tabular NRI database and then apportioned to a raster coverage of agricultural land within the county based on the Enhanced National Land Cover Dataset (NLCDe) 1-kilometer resolution land cover grids (Nakagaki, 2003). Federal land is not considered in this analysis because NRI does not record information on those lands.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f4e4b08e65d60faa92.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This dataset was created for two main purposes; (1) summarize and provide refined spatial detail to attributes of agricultural practices from the 1992 NRI dataset; and (2) to support hydrologic modeling. The U. S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program is using the spatially refined ISTR dataset to produce ancillary information for characterizing surface and ground-water sampling sites. Calculation of percentages of NAWQA study areas treated by Irrigation System by Tailwater Recovery is one example of the type of use of this data set. The 1992 NRI data was used because it was created in the same early to mid-1990s time frame as the NLCD. NAWQA plans on processing the NRI in this fashion every 5 years as new NRI and NLCDE data are published.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f4e4b08e65d60faa92.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initiated the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program in 1991 to accomplish two primary objectives. The first objective was to assess the status and trends in the quality of the Nation's ground-water and surface-water resources, and the second objective was to link the status and trends with an understanding of the natural and human factors that affect water quality (Gilliom and others, 1995). "The National Resources Inventory is a statistically based sample of land-use and natural resource conditions and trends on U.S. nonfederal lands. It is the most comprehensive database of its kind ever attempted anywhere in the world. The Natural Resources Conservation Service's program for NRI serves as the Federal Government's principal source of information on the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources in the United States. The assessment of a nation's natural resources and environmental condition provided by the NRI requires a nationally consistent database that allows for manipulation of various parameters in order to make accurate assessments. For these manipulations and subsequent analyses to be useful for public policy considerations, the NRI database has a high degree of reliability, looks at the natural resources over a period of time, and permits analyses at national, regional, and local levels. The NRI is unique because it provides a nationally consistent database for all nonfederal lands, it features data gathered and monitored in 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 by thousands of technical and natural resource data collection experts, and it has a direct correlation with soils data, which permits analysis of resources in relation to the capability of the land and in terms of soil resources and conditions. Informed and valid decisions are best made when based upon scientifically derived data. The NRI has been developed to supply this type of information. The NRI database is powerful, credible, and scientifically constructed. The present NRI is the result of many decades of development."

This dataset was derived by summarizing NRI attributes at the county level and then apportioning these county values to the NLCDe 1-km grid cells identified as agriculture within the appropriate counties. The value of each grid cell represents the estimated percentage of the 1-km grid cell that is covered by or subject to the agricultural conservation practice (CP447 ), Irrigation System by Tailwater Recovery on agricultural land by county. Kerie J. Hitt, USGS, supplied a copy of the 1992 NRI database. Naomi Nakagaki, USGS, supplied the 1-kilometer updated orchards National Land Cover Dataset (NLCDe) that was used to apportion the county areally weighted Waste Management System values onto agricultural land located within each county. The cell value for this NLCDe grid is the percentage of 30-meter resolution grid cells in the 1 by 1 kilometer area with agricultural land cover classification. All percentages are expressed as integer values. Please note that NRI does not include data for federal lands. Therefore, federal lands were excluded from the apportionment calculations and the percentages were based on land areas and county areas of nonfederal lands only. The process for summarizing and distributing NRI attributes involved the following steps:

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f4e4b08e65d60faaa2.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This data set represents the estimated percentage of the 1-km grid cell that is covered by or subject to the agricultural conservation practice (CP606), Subsurface Drains (SD) on agricultural land by county. Subsurface Drains are described as "a conduit, such as corrugated plastic tubing, tile, or pipe, installed beneath the ground surface to collect and/or convey drainage." (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1995) This data set was created with geographic information systems (GIS) and database management tools. The acres on which SD's are applied were totaled at the county level in the tabular NRI database and then apportioned to a raster coverage of agricultural land within the county based on the Enhanced National Land Cover Dataset (NLCDe) 1-kilometer resolution land cover grids (Nakagaki, 2003). Federal land is not considered in this analysis because NRI does not record information on those lands.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f4e4b08e65d60faaa2.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This dataset was created for two main purposes; (1) summarize and provide refined spatial detail to attributes of agricultural practices from the 1992 NRI dataset; and (2) to support hydrologic modeling. The U. S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program is using the spatially refined SD dataset to produce ancillary information for characterizing surface and ground-water sampling sites. Calculation of percentages of NAWQA study areas treated by Subsurface Drains is one example of the type of use of this data set. The 1992 NRI data was used because it was created in the same early to mid-1990s time frame as the NLCD. NAWQA plans on processing the NRI in this fashion every 5 years as new NRI and NLCDE data are published.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f4e4b08e65d60faaa2.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initiated the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program in 1991 to accomplish two primary objectives. The first objective was to assess the status and trends in the quality of the Nation's ground-water and surface-water resources, and the second objective was to link the status and trends with an understanding of the natural and human factors that affect water quality (Gilliom and others, 1995). "The National Resources Inventory is a statistically based sample of land-use and natural resource conditions and trends on U.S. nonfederal lands. It is the most comprehensive database of its kind ever attempted anywhere in the world. The Natural Resources Conservation Service's program for NRI serves as the Federal Government's principal source of information on the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources in the United States. The assessment of a nation's natural resources and environmental condition provided by the NRI requires a nationally consistent database that allows for manipulation of various parameters in order to make accurate assessments. For these manipulations and subsequent analyses to be useful for public policy considerations, the NRI database has a high degree of reliability, looks at the natural resources over a period of time, and permits analyses at national, regional, and local levels. The NRI is unique because it provides a nationally consistent database for all nonfederal lands, it features data gathered and monitored in 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 by thousands of technical and natural resource data collection experts, and it has a direct correlation with soils data, which permits analysis of resources in relation to the capability of the land and in terms of soil resources and conditions. Informed and valid decisions are best made when based upon scientifically derived data. The NRI has been developed to supply this type of information. The NRI database is powerful, credible, and scientifically constructed. The present NRI is the result of many decades of development."

This dataset was derived by summarizing NRI attributes at the county level and then apportioning these county values to the NLCDe 1-km grid cells identified as agriculture within the appropriate counties. The value of each grid cell represents the estimated percentage of the 1-km grid cell that is covered by or subject to the agricultural conservation practice (CP606 ), Subsurface Drains on agricultural land by county. Kerie J. Hitt, USGS, supplied a copy of the 1992 NRI database. Naomi Nakagaki, USGS, supplied the 1-kilometer updated orchards National Land Cover Dataset (NLCDe) that was used to apportion the county areally weighted Waste Management System values onto agricultural land located within each county. The cell value for this NLCDe grid is the percentage of 30-meter resolution grid cells in the 1 by 1 kilometer area with agricultural land cover classification. All percentages are expressed as integer values. Please note that NRI does not include data for federal lands. Therefore, federal lands were excluded from the apportionment calculations and the percentages were based on land areas and county areas of nonfederal lands only. The process for summarizing and distributing NRI attributes involved the following steps:

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f5e4b08e65d60faaea.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This digital data set consists of saturated thickness contours for the High Plains aquifer in Central United States, 1996-97. The High Plains aquifer extends from south of 32 degrees to almost 44 degrees north latitude and from 96 degrees 30 minutes to 104 degrees west longitude. The aquifer underlies about 174,000 square miles in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. This data set was based on 10,085 water-level measurements, 49 stream elevations, (March 1997) and 10,036 water-level elevations from wells (1,370 from 1996 and 8,666 from 1997) and the base of aquifer value for each measurement location. The saturated thickness at each measurement location was determined by subtracting the water-level elevation from the base of aquifer at that location.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f5e4b08e65d60faaea.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This data set was created to document the original map (McGuire and Fischer, 1999) produced by the High Plains Water-level Monitoring project and make available the data on this map for use with geographic information systems. This map is published in the web report "Water-level changes, 1980 to 1997, and saturated thickness, 1996-97, in the High Plains aquifer" and USGS Fact Sheet 124-99, "Water-level changes, 1980 to 1997, and saturated thickness, 1996-97, in the High Plains aquifer".
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f5e4b08e65d60faaea.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|Introduction -- The information provided in this introduction is found in U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1400-B (Gutentag and others, 1984). This data set consists of saturated thickness contours for the High Plains aquifer in Central United States, 1996-97 (modified from Weeks and Gutentag, 1981; Cederstrand and Becker, 1999). The High Plains aquifer, which underlies about 174,000 square miles in parts of eight states, is the principal water source in one of the nation's major agricultural areas. In 1980, about 170,000 wells pumped water from the aquifer to irrigate about 13 million acres. The High Plains aquifer is a regional water-table aquifer consisting mostly of near-surface sand and gravel deposits. In 1980, the maximum saturated thickness of the aquifer was about 1,000 feet and averaged about 200 feet. Hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the aquifer depend on sediment types, which vary significantly both horizontally and vertically. Hydraulic conductivity ranged from less than 25 to greater than 300 feet per day and averaged 60 feet per day. Specific yields ranged from less than 10 to 30 percent and averaged about 15 percent. The High Plains aquifer boundaries were determined by erosional extent of associated geologic units and by hydraulic and physiographic boundaries where the High Plains aquifer extends eastward from the Great Plains physiographic province (Fenneman, 1931). In most of the area, the erosional extent of the hydraulically connected Tertiary and Quaternary deposits were used as the aquifer boundary. In eastern Nebraska, streams and physiographic boundaries were used as the aquifer boundary. Reviews Applied to Data -- This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata files for completeness and accuracy.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f5e4b08e65d60faaea.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc|Selected wells screened in the High Plains aquifer that were measured in preirrigation season 1996 or 1997 and had land surface elevation determined. Selected the 1997 water-level elevation, if available, or the 1996 water-level elevation if the 1997 water-level is not available. Calculated water-level elevation for each well in the coverage, WL_PTS_ALL. ARC/INFO software and commands then were used to create the coverage. ARC/INFO commands are shown below in capitals. Step 1. Appended the available March 1997 stream-level elevations for northeastern Colorado, northwestern Kansas, and Nebraska to the WL_PTS_ALL coverage. Step 2. Used TOPOGRID to make a grid of the aquifer base using the High Plains Regional Aquifer System Analysis map (Weeks and Gutentag, 1981; Cederstrand and Becker, 1999). The grid has a cell size of 500 meters. The base of aquifer map has 200-foot contours. The scale of the base of aquifer map is 1 to 1,000,000 (Cederstrand and Becker, 1999). Step 3. Clipped aquifer base grid to the aquifer boundary using LATTICECLIP command.

Used LATTICESPOT to calculate aquifer base value for each well with water-level elevation in 1996-97 and stored in the coverage WL_PTS_ALL. Step 5. Added an item, using ADDITEM command, for saturated thickness for each well with water-level elevation in 1996-97, calculated saturated thickness for each well, and stored in cover WL_PTS_ALL.

Used TOPOGRID to make a grid of the water table from well with water-level elevation in 1996-97 and March 1997 stream-elevations. Renamed the water-table, wt_grd. Step 7. Copied the aquifer base using the COPY command. Used TOPOGRID to create the grid aquifer base, aqbase_grd.

Created the grid saturated thickness, SAT_WL_GRD, by calculating, SAT_WL_GRD = wt_grd - aqbase_grd. Step 9. Clipped the saturated thickness grid to the aquifer boundary. SAT_WL_GRD2 = SELECTPOLYGON(SAT_WL_GRD). Step 10. Sliced the saturated thickness grid by contour intervals. SLICE_SAT = SLICE (SAT_WL_GRD2, table, slice, value, value) Step 11. Changed the saturated thickness grid into an integer grid using, temp = INT (slice_sat), BUILDVAT temp, RENAME temp sat_thick_fin, RENAME sat_thick_fin sat_wl_grd commands. Step 12. Printed the saturated thickness grid (sat_wl_grd) and point values of saturated thickness (wl_pts_all) on mylar, manually modified the contours to agree with the point values or with previously published maps where current point values are not available. The final coverage of saturated thickness contours is called sat_thick_dig.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f5e4b08e65d60fab0a.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This data set was created as part of the Black Hills Hydrology Study (BHHS). The BHHS is a long-term investigation that was initiated in 1990 as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the West Dakota Water Development District. West Dakota represents various local and county cooperators. The purpose of the study is to assess the quantity, quality, and distribution of surface and ground water in the Black Hills area of western South Dakota (Driscoll, 1992). The study area includes parts of Butte, Custer, Fall River, Lawrence, Meade, and Pennington counties in South Dakota.

Reviewers were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic extent. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st files for completeness and accuracy. Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets: Potentiometric contours for the Deadwood, Madison, Minnelusa, and Minnekahta aquifers (ddwdpcon, mdsnpcon, mnlspcon, mnktpcon) and data set of wells with water-level information (inkrpwpt) for the Minnekahta aquifer. Digital data set of spring locations in the Black Hills area (spngppt). Also, surficial hydrogeology in the Black Hills study area (hydrogeo).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f5e4b08e65d60fab0a.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc|A point coverage representing wells open to the Inyan Kara aquifer (inkrpwpt) and a point coverage of springs (spngppt) reselected for those discharging from the Inyan Kara aquifer were used in plotting water-level information on a mylar sheet at 1:100,000 scale with a boundary drawn for the Black Hills study area. This sheet was overlain on a mylar sheet of equivalent scale with elevation contours, and paper plots of geologic outcrops and geologic structure for the Inyan Kara Group. These features and information were used in hand drawing contours representing water-level elevation. Water-level information from each well was considered when drawing the water-level elevation contours. Information from some wells was considered better than that from others because of variable accuracy describing location, altitude, and lithology of the wells. A numeric index was calculated for each well based on its respective accuracy (see attribute section in metadata file for data set "inkrpwpt"). Where wells were clustered, water-level information from a well with a higher index value was given more weight in drawing the contour than that from a well with a lower index value. The mylar-based contours were then digitized. The coverage was then built as a line coverage using the Arc/Info BUILD command. Pseudo nodes were removed using the UNSPLIT NONE command in Arcedit. Some arcs became jagged after the UNSPLIT. These arcs were smoothed interactively in Arcedit. The coverage was then rebuilt. Attribute items were added to the coverage arc attribute table. The attribute item INTERP was used to indicate where lines were to be dashed on the map of potentiometric surface contours. Dashed lines, represented by an INTERP value of 'Y', indicate that water level was "interpreted" in the area, and was not known because of lack of measured water levels. Other line segments, where there was confidence in water level, were assigned a value of 'N' for the INTERP attribute item, indicating that water levels for these contours was not interpreted. These non-interpreted lines were drawn as solid lines on the map. An automated method was used to assign values to the attribute item INTERP based on proximity to a well with a known water level. Wells with water-level information for the Inyan Kara aquifer (inkrpwpt) were buffered at 2000 meters, creating polygons of singular and in some cases overlapping, well buffers. Countour lines within the well buffers were assigned a value of 'N' to INTERP. Arc: BUFFER INKR_WELLS INKR_BUF2K # # 2000 # POINT Arc: IDENTITY INKR_CON INKR_BUF2K INKR_CON2K LINE # JOIN In Tables: Enter command: SEL INKR_CON2K.AAT Enter command: RES INKR_BUF2K# NE 1 Enter command: MOVE 'N' TO INTERP Enter command: ASEL Enter command: MOVE 'Y' TO INTERP Enter command: Q STOP In some instances where contour lines were close around a well, the above method assigned values of 'N' to INTERP where they should be 'Y'. Arcedit was used to change values of INTERP for these lines back to 'Y', so that they would appear dashed on the map (water level interpreted). Attribute items that were joined to the arc attribute table and were associated with the IDENTITY well buffer coverage were dropped. In some instances, very short segments of contour lines fell within the buffer regions. Any segment that was less than 100 meters in length were assigned the INTERP value of the ajoining segments for consistancy. UNSPLIT INTERP was then run on the segments to remove pseudo nodes.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea2f6e4b08e65d60fab22.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This data set was created as part of the Black Hills Hydrology Study (BHHS). The BHHS is a long-term investigation that was initiated in 1990 as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the West Dakota Water Development District. West Dakota represents various local and county cooperators. The purpose of the study is to assess the quantity, quality, and distribution of surface and ground water in the Black Hills area of western South Dakota (Driscoll, 1992). The study area includes parts of Butte, Custer, Fall River, Lawrence, Meade, and Pennington counties in South Dakota.

These items were created by staff of the BHHS. ------------------------------------------------------------ AREA: Area of the point (assigned zero). PERIMETER: Perimeter of the point (assigned zero). MDSNPWPT#: An ARC/INFO generated internal feature identity number. MDSNPWPT-ID: User-assigned feature identity number. SITEID: This is a unique number given to each well. SITEID is a combination of the latitude and longitude of the well, plus a sequence number for wells located at the same latitude and longitude. (Note: The latitudes or longitudes originally assigned to sites in GWSI occasionally are determined to be incorrect. In these cases, the latitude or longitude is corrected, but the station identification number generally remains unchanged. Thus, the latitude or longitude for an occasional site may not correspond exactly with the station identification number). WELL: This is a number based on the Federal land-survey system for western South Dakota. WELL consists of the township number followed by "N" or "S" (north or south of the Black Hills Baseline), the range number followed by "E" or "W" (east or west of the Black Hills Meridian), and the section number, followed by a maximum of four uppercase letters that indicate, respectively, the 160-, 40-, 10-, and 2.5-acre tract in which the site is located. These letters are assigned in a counterclockwise direction beginning with the letter "A" for the northeast quarter. A serial number following the last letter is used to distinguish between wells located in the same 2.5-acre tract. HEAD: The head value in each well. Head is equal to the altitude of land surface minus the water level. MEAN_HEAD: The arithmetic mean of multiple head values for the same well. Multiple head measurements exist when multiple water-level measurements were taken. AQUIFER_CODE: Unique code identifying the principal hydrogeologic unit the well is open to. LAT_LONG_ACCUR: The accuracy of the measured latitude and longitude. The accuracy ranges from one second (S) to one-minute (M). If the information is unknown, the attribute is left blank. These can be summarized as follows: > LAT_LONG_ACCUR > > - One second S > - Five seconds F > - Ten seconds T > - One minute M ALT_ACCUR: Altitude accuracy; values range from less than one foot to several hundred feet. LOG_TYPE: The type of log available for the well. If no logs were available, the attribute is left blank. The different types possible are: > LOG_TYPE > > - Drillers log D > - Electrical log E > - Fluid Cond. F > - Geologists log G > - Magnetic log H > - Induction log I > - Gamma Ray log J > - Dipmeter survey K > - Laterlog L > - Microlog M SOW: This item defines the state observation wells. State observation wells have a value of one; other wells have a value of zero.

Vessel draft was measured with each bar check and was used to calculated water depth. A CSI Wireless, Omnistar corrected differential GPS antenna mounted directly above the echosounder was used to collect the horizontal location of each depth measurement. Real-time kinematic GPS was used to measure water surface elevation at each transect, which was then used to calculate elevation of the channel bottom. Conversion to NGVD29 vertical datum was completed so that the data could be compared to existing COE benchmarks and gaging station data. The datum conversion was accomplished using the National Geodetic Survey's VERTCON program (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/VERTCON/vert_con.prl).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea311e4b08e65d60fac26.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|Introduction -- This data set consists of digital polygons of a constant hydraulic conductivity value for the alluvial and terrace deposits along the North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to Eufaula Lake in east-central Oklahoma. Ground water in 710 square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits along the North Canadian River is an important source of water for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic supplies. The aquifer, composed of alluvial and terrace deposits, consists of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. The aquifer is underlain and in hydraulic connection with the upper zone of the Permian-age Garber-Wellington aquifer and the Pennsylvanian-age Ada-Vamoosa aquifer. Other Permian and Pennsylvanian-age rocks underlying the alluvial and terrace deposits have low permeabilities and are not in hydraulic connection with the alluvial and terrace aquifer (Havens, 1989). The constant hydraulic conductivity value and some of the polygon boundaries are from a ground-water modeling report published by the U.S. Geological Survey entitled, "Geohydrology of the alluvial and terrace deposits of the North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to Eufaula Lake, central Oklahoma," by Havens (1989, p. 22 and pl. 6). Other polygon boundaries were extracted from digital surficial geology data sets by Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b) based on a scale of 1:250,000 and digitized from a paper-base map by Havens (1989, plate 6), also at a scale of 1:250,000. Hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was estimated to be 310 feet per day by Havens (1989, p. 22) and was assumed to be uniform throughout the aquifer. Digital Line Graph (DLG) format requires numbers to be stored as integers. Therefore, the hydraulic conductivity in feet per day was multiplied by 10 and stored in the digital data sets as tenths of a foot per day. For example 310 feet per day was multiplied by 10 and stored in the digital data sets as 3100 tenths of a foot per day. Permian outcrops and parts of the aquifer that were not included in the ground-water model were given a value -99999 to indicate the hydraulic conductivity is not known. Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique; different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known, then the recharge will be poorly determined. Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within a reasonable range when compared to independently collected data. In most aquifers, hydraulic conductivity measurements made in wells or in cores will range over several orders of magnitude, even over short horizontal and vertical distances. Hydraulic conductivity values derived from ground-water flow models represent areal generalizations and do not reflect the large local variance in well or core measurements. Reviews Applied to Data -- This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances, attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st files for completeness and accuracy. Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets -- This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published together for this aquifer. The four data sets are: > aqbound - aquifer boundaries > cond - hydraulic conductivity > recharg - aquifer recharge > wlelev - water-level elevation contours Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology digitized from 1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for the three Oklahoma panhandle counties) are published separately.

Some of the model-grid boundaries (Havens, 1989, plate 6) were digitized from a paper-base map with a maximum registration root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0135 map inches (0.0053 map centimeters). Hydraulic conductivity polygons represented at this scale are indicative of broad, regional trends and should not be interpreted as site-specific.

The hydraulic conductivity of 310 feet per day is stored as a K value of 3100 tenths of a foot per day. Polygons in this data set that contain a K value of -99999 represent areas where the hydraulic conductivity value is not known. K is stored in the first major code (MAJOR1) and 0 is stored in the first minor code (MINOR1) for polygons in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) version of this data set. Each line in this digital data set has an associated attribute, LSOURCE, that contains a code to indicate the line source. A LSOURCE code of 1 indicates the line is from Havens (1989) and an LSOURCE code of 2 indicates the line was extracted from Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b). LSOURCE is stored in the first major code (MAJOR1) for lines, and 0 is stored in the first minor code (MINOR1) in the DLG version of this data set.

The data was then projected from its original projection to an Albers projection using nearest-neighbor resampling. Detailed processing steps are included in this metadata file. The following documentation file also was released by CIESIN and is included here. > > >******************** BEGIN CIESIN README FILE ******************** > > The Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) > > INTEGRATED DATASETS FOR THE USA > June 27 1995 > >--------------------------------------------------------- GENERAL The primary mission of The Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), at the Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), is to develop new policy oriented applications and information products that synthesize earth science and socioeconomic data. The SEDAC policy applications development effort is the primary means by which the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) program helps to ensure that the scientific investment embodied in NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) program leads to tangible benefits. Within this framework, the "Population, Land Use and Emissions" Task (PLUE) embarked on integrating data from different sources. Specifically, data from the US decennial census (1990) and recent satelite data were integrated. In the initial attempt, the focus is on transforming census vector based data to satelite pixel based data. >From the US census data Total Persons and Total Housing Unit Structures were the selected data items (from the blockgroup geography) to be merged with the Land Cover Characteristics database (square kilometer resolution) for the conterminous United States from the EROS Data Center. This land cover was derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 1990 multitemporal satelite data. LOCATION The US census blockgroup boundary information are present on a publicly accessible FTP archive: The Archive of Census Related Products. To access this Archive connect to > ftp ftp.ciesin.org <160.39.8.201> > user <log in as anonymous or ftp> > password <enter email address> > cd /pub/census Please read the file "archive.ann" and "archive2.ann" for a detailed description of this Archive which contains 11,000+ densely compressed boundary and demographic data files. The census blockgroup boundary files are located, by state, in /pub/census/usa/tiger. The Archive may also be reached via WWW at the URL http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/us-demog/us-demog-home.html The integrated data products are posted as generic compressed ascii files in the location in ftp://ftp.ciesin.org/pub/census/usa/grid The data files, their structure and creation, are described in further detail below. A series of graphic (GIF) files provide for a quick glance at the data products. In the near future, this information will be accessible via The Interactive System for Analysis Services (ISAS), a suite of query engines for WWW browsers. LAYOUT For each state, US census data and EROS Land Cover data have been integrated, meaning both datasets are reported at the square kilometer resolution for the conterminous USA. Support files include: > gridlgd.txt legend & variable/file descriptions > griddoc.txt [this file] > gridbox.txt bounding boxes for the states > gridcomb.sas file for data processing and image creation CREATION The integrated data were created using in-house developed algorithms written in C. A proportional allocation algorithm was applied. The individual steps of data processing are described next. a) The census blockgroups, derived from the US Bureau of the Census Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing database (TIGER/Line 1992), were first projected from their latitude-longitude source to the projection used in the Land Cover Charateristics database. This coordinate system is the oblique Lamberts Azimuthal Equal Area LAZEA) projection with an origin of -100 longitude and +45 latitude. The exact equations applied to tranform TIGER92 to this projection were: >X=Rkcos(lat)sin(long-long_origin) >Y=Rk[cos(lat_origin)sin(lat)-sin(lat_origin)cos(lat)cos(long-long_origin)] > >k={2/[1+sin(lat_origin)sin(lat)+ > cos(lat_origin)cos(lat)cos(long-long_origin)]}**1/2 R is radius of sphere (by default 6,370,997 meters) [from: Map Projections-A Working Manual by John P. Snyder, USGS 1987]. b) Once the boundaries are in LAZEA format, the selected data items from the census were merged into these files and submitted to a suite of programs. c) Proportional allocation. By state, each census blockgroup's bounding box is first determined in the LAZEA X-Y system. Next the area of overlap for each pixel (km2 grid) is determined. The sum of all overlapping areas is assigned as the total area of the polygon. Next, the data items, typically count type data (such as number of persons or buildings), are distributed across the intersecting grids based on the fraction of grid-overlapping-area over total-polygon-area. These steps are repeated for all polygons within each state and the values are accumulated in memory for each grid. (A check calculation is performed by adding all grid values for the polygon in question and verifying that the actual value does sum to the original total). In a final step, the accumulated total within each LAZEA X-Y grid are divided by the area of the grid itself to arrive at density measures (in our example, each grid is 1 kilometer by 1 kilometer, but this value may be changed). d) To make the data available in a generic way, the saved binary output files, one for each state, are accessed and the data dumped out in a generic image format. The structure of these files (the ??_int.zip files in ftp://ftp.ciesin.org/pub/census/usa/grid/pall) is as follows: > >2781 3475 1862 2569 xmin xmax ymin ymax >1.000000 1.000000 xsize ysize >0.000000 0.000000 0 pdkm hdkm lckm >0.000000 0.000000 0 pdkm hdkm lckm >1.105958 4.150659 91 pdkm hdkm lckm >0.736277 3.411086 136 pdkm hdkm lckm >... ... Records are shown for each grid inside the state's bounding box. The size of the image (bounding box) is determined by the points (xmin,ymin) for lower left and (xmax,ymax) for top right. The table size is rows=ymax-ymin by cols=xmax-xmin. The grid size is, in kilometers, reported on record 2. The sequence of the records reported from line 3 till end of file begin at (xmin,ymax) on row=1, col=1. Sequentially, all grid values are reported for row=1 until the end of row=1 is encountered (cols) before the row iterates and reporting starts at (row=2,col=1). These ascii files are then zipped with a CR-LF added to the end of each record (unix users use the unzip -a option replacng CR-LF with a LF). See the file "gridcomb.sas" for more detail. The file "gridbox.txt" summarizes all the bounding boxes for all states. e) When accessing multiple states, boundary conditions need to be corrected. For example, the state boundary line between two states could split a single grid. So the grid in question will get data allocated to it by both states . When splicing multiple states together these duplicate records need to be collapsed into one record. For the users this has been done for regions of the US (See the directory /pub/census/usa/grid/pall/us). The abbreviations used are: > Regional Area States > ------------------------ -------------------------- > NE NorthEast me nh vt ma ct ri ny pa nj > SA South Atlantic dc de md wv va nc sc ga fl > ESA East South Atlantic ky tn al ms > WSA West South Atlantic ar la ok tx > ENC East North Central mi wi il in oh > WNC West North Central mn ia mo nd sd ne ks > NWM North West Mountain mt wy id > SWM South West Mountain ut az co nm > PAC Pacific wa or ca nv From these files a USgrid.asc file will be put together for the whole US. More information on this file and a program to extract, based on any 2 points defining a rectangle, will be added into this file soon. These <REGION>grid.asc files have yet another file structure simplifying spatial retrievals based LAZEA X-Y. The layout looks like: >3556 1559 42.638058 16.016323 47 lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm >3557 1559 5.12569 1.939586 47 lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm >3336 1558 1.402889 0.5097 52 lazea-X lazea-Y pdkm hdkm lckm >... The file "gridbox.txt" can be used in conjunctions with these X,Y coordinates for spatial referencing. The "USgrid.asc" file created solves the boundary problems between regions. Consult the file "us/us-dist.txt" for simple stats on these files. PROBLEMS These files currently contain two problems which have been identified. Future releases will correct for these errors or approach the problem differently. In addition, in the future we will add more census and land cover varibales as well as emissions data. 1. Water areas receiving data in allocation program. First, this is explained by those grids on the shorelines. Part of the grid is water, part of the grid is land. The proportional allocation algorithm thus allocates census data to the grids for which there is partial water. The definition of the grid being water or land should be incorporated into the algorithm to fix this. The other problem in this area is those census blockgroups who consists of a large portion of water area and a tiny land area with significant population (see the Saginaw Bay area of Lake Huron). To avoid this problem, census blocks should be used which are either land or water, not a mixture of the two. 2. An oddity was discovered when examining the District of Columbia. In this area certain pixels receive data values that absolutely have no coverage with any of the polygons in the census blockgroup layer. We are currently investigating this problem and its effect on the integrated data layers. 3. A peculiarity. Certain areas of the census blockgroup coverage are missing because we were unable to "chain" the particular polygon. In other instances, large geographic areas might not contain persons in it. In both cases the density values assinged to the grid are 0. When integrating with the Land Cover grids, the with 0 density were missed when integrating the grid data. There does exist a Land Cover Characterization Code for these grids and their density values are zero. A peculiarity we did not catch in time when processing. 4. One LCKM values in the Northwest was assigned a nonsense value over the maximum possible of 159. Please delete this value. NOTE: Please note that the term "land use" is used loosely. Land cover is a better definition. The housing unit structures density is the only measure of urban activity in these data so far. Similarly, emissions data is at the current time lacking from the design. >--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Email comments/ideas/suggestions and bug reports to ciesin.info@ciesin.org Phone them in at: 517.797.2727 >********************* END CIESIN README FILE ********************* > > REVIEWS APPLIED TO DATA This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports.

A FORTRAN program was used to reformat the file into an input format used by the ARC ASCIIGRID command. The cell size, corner coordinates, and projection came from the documentation of the data files as posted on the CIESIN ftp site. (This documentation file is included in this metadata file.) The ASCIIGRID file was formatted like this: >ncols 4587 >nrows 2889 >xllcorner -2050500 >yllcorner -2136500 >cellsize 1000 >NODATA_value -9 >4 5 3 5 3 4 5 5 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 ... (4587 values per row) (data continues for a total of 2889 rows) The ARC/INFO ASCIIGRID command was used to read this into a grid, and the PROJECT command then was used to project the grid from its original projection (Lambert Azimuthal) to the Albers projection. Nearest-neighbor resampling was done to preserve the population density values through the projection change. This processing was performed by David Wolock, U.S. Geological Survey, Lawrence, Kansas.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea334e4b08e65d60fae76.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This digital dataset defines the surface traces of regional geologic structures designated as potential ground-water flow barriers in an approximately 45,000 square-kilometer area of the Death Valley regional ground-water flow system (DVRFS) in southern Nevada and California. Most geologic structures representing potential flow barriers were faults that were identified on the basis of length, offset, type of slip, orientation with respect to predominate ground-water flow directions, the location of springs, abrupt water level offsets, and hydraulic characteristics (Sweetkind and others, 2004). A subset of the potential ground-water flow barriers was incorporated into a transient ground-water flow model of the DVRFS (Faunt and others, 2004). This model is the most recent in a number of regional-scale models developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support investigations at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and at Yucca Mountain, Nevada (see "Larger Work Citation", Chapter A, page 8).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea334e4b08e65d60fae76.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/supplinf|The potential-flow barrier data set is one of many layers in a geospatial data base supporting the USGS DVRFS project. During this 5-year (1998-2004) project the USGS, in cooperation with DOE and other Federal, State, and local agencies, developed this geospatial data base for a regional-scale, 3D hydrogeologic framework model (HFM) and a ground-water flow model. The models are intended to address water-resource issues and the potential movement of radioactive material from the Nevada Test Site and the proposed high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Data from two previous ground-water flow models of the greater Death Valley region (see "Larger Work Citation", Chapter A, p. 7) were the foundation of the DVRFS geospatial database. Those and other data were reexamined through a series of regional-scale hydrologic investigations to provide updated and spatially consistent interpretations for the DVRFS study. In some cases, new data were collected to augment the existing information. Data compiled from the studies include natural ground-water discharge occurring through evapotranspiration and spring flow; ground-water pumping for the period 1913-98; ground-water recharge simulated as net infiltration; ground-water inflow and outflow at lateral model boundaries; hydraulic conductivity and its relation to depth and other rock properties; and the estimation of water levels representative of prepumped and pumped conditions in the region. Digital elevation models, geologic maps, borehole information, cross sections, and other 3D models were used to develop the HFM which represents the geometry of 27 hydrogeologic units and structural features. The resulting geospatial data base supports characterization and conceptualization of the DVRFS, construction of 3D hydrogeologic framework and ground-water flow models, and visualization of analysis and model results.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea334e4b08e65d60fae76.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc|A subset of mapped faults was selected from a digital compilation of principal faults and structural zones potentially influencing ground-water flow in the DVRFS region (Sweetkind and others, 2004). Faults were selected on the basis of length, offset, type of slip, orientation, and hydraulic characteristics. Using a GIS, Sweetkind and others (2004) analyzed the faults relative to a potentiometric surface of the DVRFS, a map of springs, and ground-water flow paths. This data set contains the resulting faults designated as potential flow barriers. These faults were source data for the development of hydrostructural features in the transient ground-water flow model of the DVRFS (Faunt and others, 2004).

A reference point (point from which to measure the water surface) elevation was established by leveling from a nearby reference mark (wooden stake) with a known elevation. The reference point was established on the lip of the concrete inflow culvert. The elevation of the reference point was found to be 1234.36 ft (NAVD88). The elevation of the reference mark was determined by a static GPS survey. The static GPS survey data was submitted to the National Geodetic Survey's OPUS (Online Positioning Users Service) website for processing. The peak-to-peak error (difference between the maximum and minimum values obtained for the orthometric height during processing) of the OPUS solution was 0.098 feet (0.030 meters). Measuring down from the reference point (using a steel tape), the water-surface elevation of the main portion of the lake was found to be 1227.9 ft (NAVD88) on July 16, 2004. The water-surface elevation upstream from the siltation dam was determined by measuring up (using a steel tape) from the water surface of the main lake to the water surface behind the siltation dam. The elevation of the water surface behind the siltation dam was found to be 1229.6 ft (NAVD88).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea34ce4b08e65d60fb010.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc|Data collection: Bathymetry data were collected using the Bathymetric Survey System (BSS+5) with a 200-kHZ intelligent depth sounder (IDS) and a differential GPS (Novatel DGPS beacon or omnistar receiver) (Specialty Devices, Inc., 2003, Bathymetric Survey System BSS+5 with omnistar manual: Specialty Devices, Inc., Plano, Texas, 38 p.). The depth sounder emits pulses of sound that are reflected off the lake bottom and are received by a transducer. The differential GPS has a horizontal accuracy of about 1 meter (3.281 ft). Bathymetry and position data were collected and stored in Hypack Max software (ver. 2.12a) (Hydrographic Survey Software, User's Manual, Hypack Max, Coastal Oceanographics, Inc., Middlefield, Conn.). In Hypack Max, the geodetic parameters were set to UTM north, Zone 15, and ellipsoid GRS-1980. Distance (easting and northing) and depth units were both collected in feet. Current limitations of the Bathymetric Survey System (BSS+5) restrict data collection to depths greater than approximately 3.3 ft. A bar check calibration on the echo sounder was performed at the start of each day following established protocols (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1994, Engineering and design: Hydrographic survey EM 1110-2-1003, chap. 9-3, p. 9-4 to 9-9). This was done to ensure that the echo sounder was calibrated correctly. The bar check involves suspending a 2-ft-diameter flat aluminum plate directly below the echo sounder. The suspension line is marked in 5-ft increments. An initial calibration is made at 5 ft by entering the speed of sound in water (based on water temperature) and then adjusting the offset of the transducer in the computer software. The offset is the draft of the transducer below the lake surface. The aluminum plate is then lowered in 5-ft increments (depending on the range of depths expected to be encountered on the day of data collection) and adjustments in the speed of sound are made until depth readings and the depth of the aluminum plate agree to within approximately 0.1 ft. Bathymetry data were collected along planned transect lines that were set-up in Hypack Max using the internal line editor prior to data collection. Transect lines were spaced at 100-ft intervals perpendicular to the long axis of Prairie Rose Lake. Depending on boat speed, bathymetry data points were collected at approximately 5- to 10-ft intervals. Data points may be much closer in areas where transect or perimeter runs overlap. Bathymetry data points also were collected while driving the boat once around the perimeter of the lake. The distance of the boat from shore during the perimeter run varied, depending upon the depths encountered, due to the depth limitations of the data-collection equipment. The raw bathymetry data were recorded in Hypack Max as depths (in feet below water surface to the lake bottom). Target points were collected in areas of the lake where it was too shallow to collect data with the BSS+5 system. Target point depths were collected manually, using a measuring device marked in 0.10-ft increments, along with a corresponding easting and northing location. Depending on lake-bottom type and surface conditions of the lake, accuracy of these measurements can vary between 0.05 ft and 0.5 ft. The number and location of target points were based on a judgment made in the field that was thought to be spatially representative of the area. In addition, shore point locations (easting and northing) were collected to define the shoreline of the lake. These locations are collected by touching the bow of the boat to the shoreline at various intervals along the shoreline and recording the position using a bow-mounted GPS antenna. An independent bathymetry data set (in the coverage pr_ctrlpts) also was collected over a smaller area of Prairie Rose Lake. This control data set was used to estimate precision (repeatability) of the sounding data collected with the echo sounder. For Prairie Rose Lake, there were 12 paired data and control points that were located within 1.5 ft of each other with a calculated Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.11 ft. The control data set also is used to estimate the accuracy of the produced contours.

Post-processing involved removing obvious spikes, inputting depths for the time-tagged target points, and editing extraneous points within the shore point files. In addition, tide corrections were applied in Hypack Max to convert raw sounding depths to elevation. The tide file subtracts the depths from the assigned lake-surface elevation (obtained from measurement from reference point elevation to lake water surface). The processed bathymetry data in Hypack Max were sorted and exported to XYZ format. The perimeter and transect bathymetry data were weeded (thinned) to reduce the density of points in one direction (along data-collection transects) to minimize the spatial pull of contours toward the densified lines. Of the original 9,114 data points, 2,009 data points remained. A total of four separate files were exported into XYZ format: (1) transect and perimeter bathymetry data; (2) shore point location data; (3) the target point data; and (4) the target point data for behind the siltation dam. The XYZ files were then converted to ASCII text files for input into ESRI-ArcGIS (ver. 8.3).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea34ce4b08e65d60fb010.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc|Generation of Bathymetry Map: The output text files (containing northing, easting, and elevation) were input into an arc macro language (AML) script called CREATEPOINT in ARC to generate four corresponding coverages (pr_edgepts, pr_tinpts30, pr_targpts, and pr_targsdam). The pr_edgepts coverage contains the shore point locations. The pr_tinpts30 coverage contains the weeded bathymetry points collected with the depth sounder. The pr_targpts and pr_targsdam coverages contain the bathymetry target points collected manually. The projections for the coverages were then defined in ARC as UTM zone 15, NAD83, and units in feet. A polygon coverage (pr_bndry) was created for the lake shore by first connecting (digitizing in ArcEdit) the points in the pr_edgepts coverage. Digital orthophoto quads (DOQ's) (Iowa Department of Natural Resources, 2002-2003, Iowa 2002 Digital Orthophoto Update Project, information available on World Wide Web at URL http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/nrgislibx/) were later used as an aid in further adjusting the coverage of the shoreline. The polygon coverage pr_bndry was used to generate a line coverage for the main portion of the lake (pr_elevmain) and for behind the siltation dam (pr_elevsdam). An elevation field (elev) was then added to the attribute table of the coverages (pr_elevmain.aat and pr_elevsdam.aat). In ArcEdit, the elev field of the pr_elevmain coverage was set to a value of 1227.9 ft (water-surface elevation of the main lake) and the elev field of the pr_elevsdam coverage was set to a value of 1229.6 ft (water-surface elevation behind the siltation dam). The coverages (pr_bndry, pr_elevmain, pr_elevsdam) were defined in ARC as UTM zone 15, NAD83, with units in feet. To generate contours and calculate lake volume, three-dimensional surfaces (TIN models) were created using 3-D Analyst in ArcMap. The TIN (pr_tinsmooth) model was generated to create the preliminary contours. The point coverages, pr_tinpts30, pr_targpts, and pr_targsdam point, were input into pr_tinsmooth and triangulated as mass points. Height source was the "elevation" field in the point coverage attribute table. The pr_elevmain and pr_elevsdam line coverages were input as a hard line using the "elev" (elevation value = 1227.9 for the lake and 1229.6 for the siltation dam) field as the height source. The pr_bndry coverage (polygon) was input as a hard clip to clip the TIN to the lake shoreline. Additional TIN models (pr_tinmain and pr_tinsdam) were generated to calculate separately the volumes of the main lake and behind the siltation dam. The TIN (pr_tinsmooth) was used to generate the preliminary contours. The contours were generated in ARC using the TINCONTOUR command to generate the coverage pr_bth_orig. The subdivision degree was set to 3 to specify the amount of triangular subdivision to help with the smoothing. Contour intervals were set at 2 ft with a base contour of 1206 ft. The minimum contour is 1206 ft and the maximum contour is 1228 ft. The coverage pr_bth_orig was then copied to pr_bth_cont. The pr_bth_cont coverage was the edit coverage in ArcEdit where the contours were smoothed and adjusted for interpretive errors. The pr_bth_orig coverage was used as a back coverage for comparison during editing in ArcEdit. Most interpretive adjustments and smoothing were done manually by adding, moving, or deleting vertices as needed. Contour movement was generally greatest in those contours with sharp bends. The independent bathymetry data set (in the coverage pr_ctrlpts) collected over a smaller area of Prairie Rose Lake was used to estimate accuracy of the contours. For Prairie Rose Lake, there were 35 paired contours and control points that were located within 0.5 ft of each other with a calculated Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.86 ft. The volume for Prairie Rose Lake was calculated in ArcMap/3-D Analyst using the pr_tinmain and pr_tinsdam TIN models. The volume for the main lake section was calculated above a reference plane (lake-surface elevation) of -1227.9 ft. The volume behind the siltation dam was calculated above a reference plane (lake-surface elevation) of -1229.6 ft. The TIN models were inverted for calculation purposes only, following guidelines in ESRI-ArcGIS (ver. 8.3). ArcMap/3-D Analyst uses linear interpolation to calculate the area and volume of those portions of the TIN surface lying between the specified base value (lake-surface elevation) and the highest point in the TIN. Water volume for the main lake section was calculated to be 66,382,000 cubic feet. Water volume behind the siltation dam was calculated to be 620,000 cubic feet. Data from this survey show that the total surface area of Prairie Rose Lake and the siltation pond, at a water-surface elevation of 1,227.9 ft and 1,229.6 ft, respectively, is approximately 8,264,000 square feet (190 acres) and the total water volume is approximately 67,002,000 cubic feet (1,540 acre-ft).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea365e4b08e65d60fb1ce.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This raster data set represents water-level change in the High Plains aquifer of the United States from 1995 to 2000, in feet. The High Plains aquifer underlies 112.6 million acres (176,000 square miles) in parts of eight States: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. The aquifer's saturated thickness ranges from near zero to about 1,200 feet (Weeks and Gutentag, 1981). Water-level declines occurred in parts of the High Plains aquifer soon after the onset of substantial irrigation with groundwater (about 1950) (Luckey and others, 1981; Gutentag and others, 1984). This data set was generated in a geographic information system from water-level-change data from wells measured in 1995 and 2000 and from some additional wells in New Mexico, which were measured in 1996, 1997, 2001, and 2002. For this data set, areas of no substantial change were designated as areas where water-level change was between a rise of 1 foot and a decline of 1 foot; the raster was set to zero in the areas of no substantial change.

Then the ESRI ArcInfo Workstation Version 9.3 GRID contour command was used to contour the raster for the following ranges (in feet): -35 and less, -35 to -25, -25 to -15, -15 to -5, -5 to -2, -2 to -1, -1 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 5, 5 to 15, and greater than 15. These contours were manually modified in areas with few water-level-change data values to limit the effects of isolated data values on the contours in those areas.

To help address these concerns, ground- and surface-water conditions in the area before and during the population growth that started in the 1970s was evaluated. This dataset helps analyze trends in ground-water data, documents 2006 hydrologic conditions, and is used to compare 2006 and historic ground-water data of the Wood River Valley of south-central Idaho. It represents ground-water conditions in the unconfined aquifer during October 2006 constructed from 88 water-level measurements in the main valley and 8 tributary canyons.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea37be4b08e65d60fb37e.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The Sprague River drains 4090 square kilometers in south-central Oregon before flowing into the Williamson River and upper Klamath Lake. In cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USGS and University of Oregon conducted a study to evaluate channel and floodplain processes for the 131 km of the Sprague River and its major tributaries, including the lower 20 km of the South Fork Sprague River, the lower 16 km of the North Fork Sprague River, and the lower 62 km of the Sycan River. The study involved multiple analyses, including assessments of historical channel change, riparian and floodplain vegetation, and surficial geology. To support these analyses, digital floodplain and channel maps were prepared from historic notes, maps, and aerial photos to depict channel and floodplain conditions at different times between 1866 and 2005. The geospatial database of current and historic channel and floodplain conditions will also enable evaluation of long-term trends pertaining to aquatic and riparian habitat conditions.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea37be4b08e65d60fb37e.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|These data were created to support understanding of geomorphic conditions and historical changes to channel and floodplain conditions for the Sprague River and the lower portions of its major tributaries. GIS layers depicting channel centerlines, water features, fluvial bars, floodplain vegetation, and floodplain features such as irrigation canals, levees and dikes, and roads were created from aerial photographs dating from 1940, 1968, and 2000. The purpose of this mapping was to track changes in channel and floodplain morphology and vegetation over time and to measure changes in channel position. Historical aerial photographs from 1940 and 1968 were acquired, scanned, and rectified for this project, while digital orthophotographs from 2000 are publicly available. (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). In addition, channel centerlines were mapped from publicly available coverages for 1975 (Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey of Klamath County) and 2005 (U.S. Department of Agriculture NAIP imagery). The surficial geologic mapping was done to support understanding of the geologic context of the modern floodplain, and encompasses the alluvial valleys of the Sprague River and the lower portions of the Sycan, North Fork, and South Fork Sprague Rivers.

Completed in 2008. Digitizing Protocol: The Sprague River Project is focused on geomorphic and vegetation changes over time within the active geomorphic floodplain of the Sprague River watershed. We defined the active geomorphic floodplain as the area adjacent to the channel system that is low-lying and displays geomorphic features typical of channel erosion and depositional processes clearly on imagery, including aerial photos, 7.5 min USGS topo maps, and LIDAR images (Watershed Sciences, 2005). Geomorphic features used to define the extent of the active geomorphic floodplain included point bars, scroll bars, abandoned channels (including oxbows ponds and filled channels), and swell and swale topography. The active geomorphic floodplain was distinguished from adjacent alluvial surfaces that are smoother and show less evidence of erosion and deposition, although some of these adjacent surfaces may be flooded regularly by overbank flows. Digital data sets were first digitized from the 2000 DOQs. High resolution LiDAR imagery data (Watershed Sciences, 2005) was used to identify topographic details that assisted in feature classification. If the feature visible in the LiDAR was not visible in the 2000 DOQ the feature was not digitized. Additional comparison with the 1998 color air photo mosaic (USFWS 1998) aided in evaluating the 2000 DOQs. The 2000 digital data was then used as a template for digitizing features from the 1968 and 1940s photo sets. Because the spatial context of this project is focused within the active geomorphic floodplain, interpreting and digitizing the floodplain boundary was prioritized to define area of digitization in all three year sets. Original data sets were digitized in ArcMap as separate shapefiles (line or polygon). Line files were "buffered" in ArcMAP to generate polygons with a calculable area for these features. All digitizing was reviewed and edited by the graduate research assistants or project leaders for interpretation consistency and data accuracy. After editing, the shapefiles were input into a geodatabase. The geodatabase was used to organize the data sets by data type and subtype, feature prioritization, and topology rules.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea37ce4b08e65d60fb3a6.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The Sprague River drains 4090 square kilometers in south-central Oregon before flowing into the Williamson River and upper Klamath Lake. In cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USGS and University of Oregon conducted a study to evaluate channel and floodplain processes for the 131 km of the Sprague River and its major tributaries, including the lower 20 km of the South Fork Sprague River, the lower 16 km of the North Fork Sprague River, and the lower 62 km of the Sycan River. The study involved multiple analyses, including assessments of historical channel change, riparian and floodplain vegetation, and surficial geology. To support these analyses, digital floodplain and channel maps were prepared from historic notes, maps, and aerial photos to depict channel and floodplain conditions at different times between 1866 and 2005. The geospatial database of current and historic channel and floodplain conditions will also enable evaluation of long-term trends pertaining to aquatic and riparian habitat conditions.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea37ce4b08e65d60fb3a6.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|These data were created to support understanding of geomorphic conditions and historical changes to channel and floodplain conditions for the Sprague River and the lower portions of its major tributaries. GIS layers depicting channel centerlines, water features, fluvial bars, floodplain vegetation, and floodplain features such as irrigation canals, levees and dikes, and roads were created from aerial photographs dating from 1940, 1968, and 2000. The purpose of this mapping was to track changes in channel and floodplain morphology and vegetation over time and to measure changes in channel position. Historical aerial photographs from 1940 and 1968 were acquired, scanned, and rectified for this project, while digital orthophotographs from 2000 are publicly available. (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). In addition, channel centerlines were mapped from publicly available coverages for 1975 (Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey of Klamath County) and 2005 (U.S. Department of Agriculture NAIP imagery). The surficial geologic mapping was done to support understanding of the geologic context of the modern floodplain, and encompasses the alluvial valleys of the Sprague River and the lower portions of the Sycan, North Fork, and South Fork Sprague Rivers.

A separate topology was run to edit digitizing overlap with the floodplain boundary data set and the features digitized within it to ensure all features were enclosed within the final floodplain boundary.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea37ce4b08e65d60fb3a6.xml|/metadata/dataqual/complete|Data are complete. Digitization of features occurred at a scale of 1:1000. In general, all features that were clearly visible at that scale were digitized. Minimum size and density specifications for digitizing are listed in each attribute definition. Where vegetation overhang and shadows overlapped with other features within the floodplain boundary digitizing an accurate boundary of the covered feature was attempted. Interpreting the boundary of the covered feature (Water, Built Feature or Bar) was done by extrapolating edges from visible data. Varied discharge associated with different photo dates occasionally resulted in discontinuity of water features at photo overlap and boundaries. In the situation of discontinuity at overlap one photo was exchanged for a bordering photo at approximately the mid-point of overlap and features were digitized to the photo being utilized. When discontinuity occurred at image boundaries or the photo exchange point the water feature with the greatest area was digitized. Mean daily discharges associated with different photo dates are recorded in the Photo Sets and Related Stream Discharge.xls spreadsheet located inside the SpragueRiverAnalysis.mdb file. Vegetation is defined as land cover classification on all terrestrial surfaces within the floodplain boundary. In digitizing vegetation from the 2000 photo set, ground truthing information collected the summer of 2007 was used to verify a portion of tall woody species locations and relative distributions. Ground truthing photos and notes were also used to validate distinctions between short homogeneous short woody patches vs. herbaceous patches. 2005 color aerial photographs (NAIP, 2005) were also used as cross reference. The photo set for 1968 posed some interpretation challenges as some of the photos were taken in early spring prior to leaf out of both short and tall deciduous species. Identification of aspen stands required use of alternate characteristics such as thin linear shadows and round, gray crown tops for mapping, along with considerable cross referencing of 2000 and 1940s photos for general locations. Short woody species in the upper basin (upstream of Kamkaun Springs reach) were often still bare, but were recognizable with stem structure and reliance on other photo sets for location. Photos from the 1940s set were of lower quality and required greater dependence on color than texture for tall vs. short woody classification, and texture more than color for differentiation between woody vegetation and water. Some patches of vegetation exhibited characteristics of both tall woody and short woody features, required the use of species habitat preferences for classification. Aspen were rarely found immediately next to water features, and occupy only certain reaches of the river. Ponderosa pines were found mostly in the canyon sections and at the far margins of the floodplains. Short woody plants were found in combination with tall woody species in all reaches, appearing in wide valley sections at nearly any distance from the main channel or secondary water features.

Completed in 2008. Digitizing Protocol: The Sprague River Project is focused on geomorphic and vegetation changes over time within the active geomorphic floodplain of the Sprague River watershed. We defined the active geomorphic floodplain as the area adjacent to the channel system that is low-lying and displays geomorphic features typical of channel erosion and depositional processes clearly on imagery, including aerial photos, 7.5 min USGS topo maps, and LIDAR images (Watershed Sciences, 2005). Geomorphic features used to define the extent of the active geomorphic floodplain included point bars, scroll bars, abandoned channels (including oxbows ponds and filled channels), and swell and swale topography. The active geomorphic floodplain was distinguished from adjacent alluvial surfaces that are smoother and show less evidence of erosion and deposition, although some of these adjacent surfaces may be flooded regularly by overbank flows. Digital data sets were first digitized from the 2000 DOQs. High resolution LiDAR imagery data (Watershed Sciences, 2005) was used to identify topographic details that assisted in feature classification. If the feature visible in the LiDAR was not visible in the 2000 DOQ the feature was not digitized. Additional comparison with the 1998 color air photo mosaic (USFWS 1998) aided in evaluating the 2000 DOQs. The 2000 digital data was then used as a template for digitizing features from the 1968 and 1940s photo sets. Because the spatial context of this project is focused within the active geomorphic floodplain, interpreting and digitizing the floodplain boundary was prioritized to define area of digitization in all three year sets. Original data sets were digitized in ArcMap as separate shapefiles (line or polygon). Line files were "buffered" in ArcMAP to generate polygons with a calculable area for these features. All digitizing was reviewed and edited by the graduate research assistants or project leaders for interpretation consistency and data accuracy. After editing, the shapefiles were input into a geodatabase. The geodatabase was used to organize the data sets by data type and subtype, feature prioritization, and topology rules.

Bare features were identified by a very light tone that results in a whiteness of coloration relative to adjacent surfaces, and typically had a smooth and uniform texture. All road, bridge, building, railroad, and bar features were also classified as Bare, as well as scoured or disturbed features on the floodplain. Bars and Built Features classified as Bare are identified in Notes field of the attribute table for year sets 1940s, 1968, and 2000.

Short woody species are those less than 6 meters tall. Height distinctions were made on visual interpretation. Actual height of plants initially used to distinguish classification for 2000 air photo set off of LiDAR imagery when visual identification was difficult (shrub (short woody) 1.5-3 meters). A slightly lighter tone than the darker tone of tall woody was classified as short woody vegetation. Individual plants with a relatively smaller foliage diameter area were classified as short woody vegetation.

Tall woody species are those judged to be greater than approximately 6 meters tall. Height distinctions were made on visual interpretation. Actual height of plants initially used to distinguish classification for 2000 air photo set off of LiDAR imagery when visual identification was difficult (trees (tall woody) > 3 meters). A darker tone was used to identify tall woody vegetation where visible shadows were lacking, usually due to proximity of individual plants to each other. The darker tone depicts a roughness difference between canopy vegetation and herbaceous coverage and also reflects a typically darker green color of aspen and ponderosa pine. Isolated patches of darker toned vegetation was more likely to have shadows. Individual plants with a larger diameter foliage cover were classified as tall woody vegetation.

This coverage is comprised of 105 Catalog Units (CUs) obtained from http://nhd.usgs.gov/. Each CU approximately represents a single 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC).
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea385e4b08e65d60fb3ca.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This coverage was used to determine parameters required to use regression equations presented by Koltun (2003). This dataset can be used to determine the location and extent of hydrography based solely on the centerlines of hydrographic features in Ohio and portions of Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. Area and boundary features of lakes, ponds, etc., cannot be determined from this dataset. This dataset was created to derive data related to drainage density and main-channel length for selected basins inside and outside of Ohio. The scale of the dataset is 1:100,000 and should not be used with data at scales greater than this.

One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy: - manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots. - symbolized display of the digital line graph on an interactive computer graphic system. - Selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names on reaches were validated against a March 1999 extract from the Geographic Names Information System.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|535ea386e4b08e65d60fb41e.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The Umpqua River drains 12,103 square kilometers (4,673 square miles) in southwest Oregon before flowing into the Pacific Ocean at Winchester Bay near the city of Reedsport. In cooperation with the Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the USGS evaluated sediment transport and gravel storage along the downstream alluvial reaches of the North and South Umpqua Rivers and the entire mainstem Umpqua River. This includes the lower 46.8 kilometers (29.1 miles) of the North Umpqua River and the lower 122.6 kilometers (76.2 miles) of the South Umpqua River. The Umpqua River gravel transport study involved multiple analyses, including tracking patterns of historical channel change and estimation of a sediment budget. To support these analyses, digital channel maps were produced to depict channel and floodplain conditions along the Umpqua River system from different time periods. GIS layers defining the active channel of the Umpqua River system were developed for three time periods: 1939, 1967, and 2005. For the South Umpqua River and the 19 kilometers (12 miles) of the mainstem Umpqua River downstream from the confluence of the North and South Umpqua Rivers, GIS layers were also developed for the time periods 1994, 2000, and 2009. For this project, the active channel was defined as area typically inundated during annual high flows, and includes the low-flow channel as well as side channels, islands, and channel-flanking gravel bars. The active channel datasets were developed by digitizing from aerial photographs. Aerial photographs from 1939 and 1967 were scanned, rectified, and mosaiced for this project. Digital orthophotographs from 1994, 2000, 2005, and 2009 are publicly available (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). Although our study area encompasses the Umpqua River and lower reaches of the North and South Umpqua Rivers, the extent of each dataset depended upon the underlying aerial photographs; for example, the 1967 photographs extend only as far downstream as floodplain kilometer 7, whereas the 1939 and 2005 datasets extend to the mouth of the Umpqua River at the Pacific Ocean.

Arc Info 'point' coverages are created and used to make an illustration showing the hydrologic data sites for each county in the State of Utah. Each coverage is converted to the form of an Arc export file represented by an .e00 extension. The names are given by county. The form is:: ut_<county name>.e00. The coverages made with latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. The USGS Water Resources Division Web Node keeps these files and distributes them over the web. Steps to make these files: A. The NWIS database is queried and items extracted. B. The retrieved query items are then made into ARC/INFO coverages. C. The ARC/INFO coverages are made into an Arc export file format with the extension .e00. D.

Arc Info 'point' coverages are created and used to make an illustration showing the hydrologic data sites for each county in the State of Utah. Each coverage is converted to the form of an Arc export file represented by an .e00 extension. The names are given by county. The form is: ut_<county name>.e00. The coverages made with latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. The USGS Water Resources Division Web Node keeps these files and distributes them over the web. Steps to make these files: A. The NWIS database is queried and items extracted. B. The retrieved query items are then made into ARC/INFO coverages. C. The ARC/INFO coverages are made into an Arc export file format with the extension .e00. D. Export format files are sent to the USGS Web Node for distribution over the Internet. __________________________________________________________ NWIS database is queried and items extracted. 1. lat_va Latitude, dms (degree, minute, second) 2. long_va Longitude, dms 3. coord_datum_cd Coordinate datum: NAD 27 (North American Datum, 1927) 4. site_id Site Identification Number, USGS 5. left(station_nm,24) Left 24 characters of station number, USGS 6. station_type_cd Station type: YNNNNNN Stream NYNNNNN Lake/Reservoir NNYNNNN Estuary NNNYNNN Specific Source NNNNYNN Spring NNNNNYN Groundwater other than spring NNNNNNY Meteorlogical 7. agency_use_cd Agency use: A active I inactive O inventory only 8. state_cd State: 49 Utah 9. county_cd County: 001 Beaver 003 Boxelder 005 Cache 007 Carbon 009 Daggett 011 Davis 013 Duchesne 015 Emery 017 Garfield 019 Grand 021 Iron 023 Juab 025 Kane 027 Millard 029 Morgan 031 Piute 033 Rich 035 Salt Lake 037 San Juan 039 Sanpete 041 Sevier 043 Summit 045 Tooele 047 Uintah 049 Utah 051 Wasatch 053 Washington 055 Wayne 057 Weber 10. site_use_1_cd Site Use: A anode C standby emergency D drain E geothermal G seismic H heat reservoir M mine O observation P petroleum, oil or gas R recharge S repressurize T test U unused W withdrawal X waste Z destroyed 11. water_use_1_cd Water Use: A air conditioning B bottling C commercial D dewater E power F fire H domestic I irrigation J industrial (cooling) K mining M medicinal N industrial P public supply Q aquaculture R recreation S stock T institutional U unused Y desalination Z other 12. alt_va Altitude of land surface at the site, ft 13. alt_datum_cd Altitude datum, NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum) 14. hole_depth_va Hole depth drilled total, ft below land surface datum 15. well_depth_va Well depth, ft below land surface datum This is defined as: The greatest depth to which the well can be sounded. _____________________________________________________________________ ARC/INFO attribute NWIS item AREA PERIMETER UT_<COUNTY NAME># UT_<COUNTY NAME>-ID LATITUDE lat_va Latitude, dms LONGITUDE long_va Longitude, dms HORIZ_DATUM coord_datum Coordinate datum: NAD 27 SITE_ID site_id Site Identification Number, USGS LOCAL left(station_nm,24) Station Number, USGS STATION_TYPE station_type Station type: YNNNNNN Stream NYNNNNN Lake/Reservoir NNYNNNN Estuary NNNYNNN Specific Source NNNNYNN Spring NNNNNYN Groundwater other than spring NNNNNNY Meteorlogical AGENCY_USE agency_use_cd Agency use: A active I inactive O inventory only STATE_CODE state_cd State: 49 Utah COUNTY_CODE county_cd County: 001 Beaver 003 Boxelder 005 Cache 007 Carbon 009 Daggett 011 Davis 013 Duchesne 015 Emery 017 Garfield 019 Grand 021 Iron 023 Juab 025 Kane 027 Millard 029 Morgan 031 Piute 033 Rich 035 Salt Lake 037 San Juan 039 Sanpete 041 Sevier 043 Summit 045 Tooele 047 Uintah 049 Utah 051 Wasatch 053 Washington 055 Wayne 057 Weber SITE_USE site_use_1_cd Site Use: A anode C standby emergency D drain E geothermal G seismic H heat reservoir M mine O observation P petroleum, oil or gas R recharge S repressurize T test U unused W withdrawal X waste Z destroyed WATER_USE water_use_1_cd Water Use: A air conditioning B bottling C commercial D dewater E power F fire H domestic I irrigation J industrial (cooling) K mining M medicinal N industrial P public supply Q aquaculture R recreation S stock T institutional U unused Y desalination Z other ALTITUDE alt_va Altitude of land surface at the site, ft VERT_DATUM alt_datum_cd Altitude datum, NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum) HOLE_DEPTH hole_depth_va Hole depth drilled total, ft below land surface datum WELL_DEPTH well_depth_va Well depth, ft below land surface datum This is defined as: The greatest depth to which the well can be sounded.

The differences between the geophysical log control point and the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface at each location represents how accurate the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface is to the "real world" geophysical log control point. Mean differences (correlation altitude on the geophysical logs minus interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface altitude) is the average difference between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surfaces at the location of the geophysical log control point. Minimum and maximum differences are those measured between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surfaces; absolute mean error is the error between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologis surfaces.

The hydrogeologic unit dataset contains 414 rows and 394 columns representing 1-mile grid spacing. In general, limitations of data interpolation included areas of sparse geophysical log control points, log datums not clearly defined for some logs, unknown exact extent of each hydrogeologic unit in subcrop, interpolation limitations, and values averaged over 1-mile grid spacing.

The differences between the geophysical log control point and the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface at each location represents how accurate the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface is to the "real world" geophysical log control point. Mean differences (correlation altitude on the geophysical logs minus interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface altitude) is the average difference between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surfaces at the location of the geophysical log control point. Minimum and maximum differences are those measured between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surfaces; absolute mean error is the error between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologis surfaces.

The digital surfaces were developed to define and display the hydrogeologic framework for the Mississippi Embayment Regional Aquifer Study (MERAS). The digital surfaces also provide a foundation of the selected hydrogeologic units for development of a steady-state and transient regional ground-water flow model of the Mississippi embayment aquifer system from the top of the Midway confining unit upwards to land surface. The ground-water flow model is under development as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Ground-Water Resources Program.

The hydrogeologic unit dataset contains 414 rows and 394 columns representing 1-mile grid spacing. In general, limitations of data interpolation included areas of sparse geophysical log control points, log datums not clearly defined for some logs, unknown exact extent of each hydrogeologic unit in subcrop, interpolation limitations, and values averaged over 1-mile grid spacing.

The differences between the geophysical log control point and the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface at each location represents how accurate the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface is to the "real world" geophysical log control point. Mean differences (correlation altitude on the geophysical logs minus interpolated digital hydrogeologic surface altitude) is the average difference between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surfaces at the location of the geophysical log control point. Minimum and maximum differences are those measured between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologic surfaces; absolute mean error is the error between the unit correlation altitudes on the geophysical logs and the altitudes of the interpolated digital hydrogeologis surfaces.

The digital surfaces were developed to define and display the hydrogeologic framework for the Mississippi Embayment Regional Aquifer Study (MERAS). The digital surfaces also provide a foundation of the selected hydrogeologic units for development of a steady-state and transient regional ground-water flow model of the Mississippi embayment aquifer system from the top of the Midway confining unit upwards to land surface. The ground-water flow model is under development as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Ground-Water Resources Program.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|543559a3e4b0a4f4b46a2515.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|Four polygon vector data sets and one related table describe land-cover in Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area (RRC_NCA_p) and Coyote Springs (CS_ACEC_p), Piute-Eldorado Valley (PEV_ACEC_p), and Mormon Mesa (MM_ACEC_p) Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, Clark County, Nevada. One polygon vector data set per Area is attributed with land-cover at the vegetation stand level (abbreviated with a stand code) and the corresponding alliance level of the National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVC; Federal Geographic Data Committee, 2008). The table (tbl_NVC) is related to each of the four polygon data sets and contains the NVC classification from the group to class level. DigitalGlobe's QuickBird multispectral satellite imagery was classified with field vegetation data (Charlet and others, 2014) collected at the stand level using Visual Learning Systems' Feature Analyst feature extraction software. Non-vegetation data layers, such as roads and disturbed areas, were manually delineated from the QuickBird imagery. The process steps have been generalized to apply to all study areas. Details about processing, such as vegetation samples used for training input and major changes made during photo interpretation are detailed in the larger work. For simplicity, the process dates are listed as the final publication date. Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area was processed during 2008, Coyote Springs Area of Critical Environmental Concern during 2011, Piute-Eldorado Valley Area of Critical Environmental Concern during 2012, and Mormon Mesa Area of Critical Environmental Concern during 2013.

This process is a proprietary process that accepts an exemplary training site as input and classifies imagery based on the spectral and spatial characteristics of the pixels within the training site. Parameters may be set that affect the feature extraction process including the shape and number of pixels analyzed, the type of learning algorithm applied, and the number of pixels to aggregate in the output. The process is iterative in that the analyst may identify correctly and incorrectly classified areas and then rerun the extraction process as many times as necessary until the image has been correctly classified. The AFE model produced by the extraction process then may be used to classify additional images in a batch process. Polygons were digitized around selected individual vegetation sample points (Charlet and others, 2014) and input individually as training sites to produce many independent AFE models for each study area. Parameters were set as follows: algorithm = general purpose approach 1; analysis area shape = circular; analysis area width = 11 pixels; aggregrate = 176 pixels. AFE models were produced with single QuickBird digital orthophoto quarter-quadrangles (DOQQ) and then batch processed for groups of temporally similar DOQQs. Details on groupings are available in the larger work text. The AFE models output a shapefile (a type of vector geospatial data set) for each DOQQ. The resulting shapefiles were merged into a single shapefile for each AFE model and edited to correct edge effects.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|543559a3e4b0a4f4b46a2515.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdate|20140101

The grids were snapped to the cell size (2.4 meters) and extent of the QuickBird DOQQ footprint for each study area. Each grid was assigned a unique pixel value representing the AFE model that produced it. The ESRI ArcGIS Combine tool was used to analyze confused pixels, i.e., those pixels that were classified as more than one type of vegetation. The grids covering each study area were progressively combined using conditional statements in ArcGIS until a single grid representing vegetation remained for each study area. The feature extraction and raster processing steps were iterative. Additional AFE models were created after analyzing the combined grids. These additional results replaced confused pixels or filled in unclassified pixels. Not all pixels were classified for each study area. See the larger work for additional information on combining and resolving confusion in the vegetation grids.

Some pixels were reclassified based on this data or other knowledge of the area. A summary of changes made during the photo interpretation process is available in the larger work report.

Three road layers were created by buffering the centerlines: one based on known widths for maintained paved roads and two based on widths measured on-screen for unmaintained paved roads and unpaved roads. A ruderal layer was created by buffering the maintained road centerlines by known widths. Disturbed areas were digitized on-screen from the QuickBird imagery. Wildfire scars and clouds were classified with AFE models and edited on-screen. The non-vegetation layers were converted from polygon feature classes to ESRI grid format using the ESRI ArcGIS Feature to Raster tool. The ruderal, disturbed areas, wildfire scars, and clouds were mosaicked into the final vegetation grids. The three road layers remained separate until the final process step.

The ERDAS Imagine 2011 Clump and Eliminate routines were used to filter out any groups of pixels smaller than the minimum mapping unit of 176 pixels. In order to maintain the buffered widths of the road layers, they were mosaicked into the final data set after filtering. This process resulted in a small number of slivers in the final data sets smaller than the minimum mapping unit. Each IMG file was converted to a file geodatabase polygon feature class. Attributes for map class, NVC alliance, and NVC group code were added from a spreadsheet based on pixel value. A relationship class was created from each study area feature class to the table containing the National Vegetation Classification Standard hierarchy (tbl_NVC) using the GROUP_CD attribute. The shapefile versions of the data include all related attributes within the shapefiles.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c089e4b02acb4f0c92c4.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|According to the U.S. Geological Survey, an estimated 258 million people nationwide, or 86% of the U.S. population, relied on public water supplies for their household use in 2005 (USGS, 2013). The remaining population obtains their water from different sources, such as a domestic self-supply well. However, the spatial distribution of water supply systems has not been compiled. Mapping where these people are located can be done within a GIS (Geographic Information System). The approach used takes into account a number of different attributes gathered from the United States Census Bureau for the block group and block shapes within the Delaware River Basin.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c089e4b02acb4f0c92c4.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|This dataset shows the geographic distribution of water supply throughout the Delaware River Basin extent. The data is broken down by Census block group shapes for the year 2010. This dataset was developed as part of a U.S. Geological Survey study regarding the water use throughout the Delaware River Basin. It is used to spatially show where the domestic self-supplied water users resided for this Census year.

The U.S. Geological Survey’s National Water-Use Information Program (NWUIP) compiles water use data on a national, regional, state, and county scale. Every five years, population totals and quantitative amounts of water are published in a national circular. It provides a statistical break down of the populations’ water-use into different categories, such as: public supply, commercial use, domestic-self supply, irrigation/agriculture, and thermoelectric (U.S. Geological Survey, 2014). This allows us to see the total sum of people that are obtaining their water from and for these sources. However, not all of the data is pertinent to this study. The most important piece is the category that totals county populations which are being served from a public supply source. The United State Census is a decadal dataset that accounts for an abundance of numerical information. The Census essentially counts every resident that resides in the United States, and tallies up a comprehensive volume of information regarding the population. Data is collected and made available at different scales; such as by state, county, or zip code. The Census also has smaller shapes (block groups and blocks), and these offer the highest resolutions. Spatially, they are the most intricate. The 1990 Census was the only one to include water use information. Typically, the U.S. Census will collect the same information every year, which enables them to show comparisons and changes. However, the 1990 year included more data (water use being one topic) which was made available for the smaller Census shapes. This category of data has not been collected since. The Census data was obtained through a third party organization, National Historical Geographic Information System, and they simplified the data download process.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c089e4b02acb4f0c92c4.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdate|20130501
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c089e4b02acb4f0c92c4.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc|The results for 1990 are used as the foundation to forecast the public supply areas into future Census years. The 2010 Census did not gather data on water use, so there is no way to calculate a new Housing Units Public Supply Percentage (HU PS%) for this year. However, population data was used to calculate a population density for the block group shapes during this year. Again, the population density, “Pop_Density_Populated_Areas”, looks specifically at the density within the populated areas of the block group. The vacant block areas within the block group were removed. This gives a true representation of the population density within the populated areas of the block group. The calculation for this is "Population" / "Populated_Sq_Miles". The population density will gauge whether a shape flips from domestic to public supply in the future years. As an example, if the population density of a domestic self-supplied block group increases over its Counties’ population density 95th percentile, it would be now be considered publicly supplied. This is caused by a population growth within the block group shape. Keep in mind that the Counties’ 95th percentiles for population density (which was calculated from the 1990 data), will remain that value into the future.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c089e4b02acb4f0c92c4.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdate|20130501

So, all block groups that are publicly supplied in 2000 must also be that for the year 2010. A public supply area would never switch to domestic self-supply. Once a block group is classified as public supply, it will always be that, regardless if the population density decreases over the following Census year. The one issue was that the actual shapes of the block group had changed from the 2000 to 2010 Census. It was hard to ensure that all public supply block group shapes in 2000 were being reflected as such in 2010. The remedy to this was applying a select by center operation. Using ArcMap, you can create a new selection based upon a previously selected set. The block groups for 2010 were deemed public supply if the center of their shape falls within the boundaries of a public supply block group in 2000. Knowing that public supply areas will always remain public supply as a whole, the only shapes that can differ between time periods are the domestic self-supplied areas in 2000. If the population density of the 2010 Census block group shapes in these locations increase over their Counties’ 95th percentile, they would be flipped to public supply. This in turn shows an expansion of public supply areas over the ten year period.

After the water source for each block group shape has been identified (throughout the entire County), those block groups that do not intersect the boundary extent are removed from the coverage. These block groups are not part of the study. However, they need to be included within the approach because the NWUIP is summing public supply population based on entire Counties. They play a role when looking at Counties as a whole, but are simply removed at the end.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c095e4b02acb4f0c92d2.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|This digital data release consists of seven data files of soil attributes for the United States and the District of Columbia. The files are derived from Natural Resources Conservations Service’s (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO). The data files can be linked to the raster datasets of soil mapping unit identifiers (MUKEY) available through the NRCS’s Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/geo/?cid=nrcs142p2_053628). The associated files, named DRAINAGECLASS, HYDRATING, HYDGRP, HYDRICCONDITION, LAYER, TEXT, and WTDEP are area- and depth-weighted average values for selected soil characteristics from the SSURGO database for the conterminous United States and the District of Columbia. The SSURGO tables were acquired from the NRCS on March 5, 2014. The soil characteristics in the DRAINAGE table are drainage class (DRNCLASS), which identifies the natural drainage conditions of the soil and refers to the frequency and duration of wet periods. The soil characteristics in the HYDRATING table are hydric rating (HYDRATE), a yes/no field that indicates whether or not a map unit component is classified as a "hydric soil". The soil characteristics in the HYDGRP table are the percentages for each hydrologic group per MUKEY. The soil characteristics in the HYDRICCONDITION table are hydric condition (HYDCON), which describes the natural condition of the soil component. The soil characteristics in the LAYER table are available water capacity (AVG_AWC), bulk density (AVG_BD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (AVG_KSAT), vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity (AVG_KV), soil erodibility factor (AVG_KFACT), porosity (AVG_POR), field capacity (AVG_FC), the soil fraction passing a number 4 sieve (AVG_NO4), the soil fraction passing a number 10 sieve (AVG_NO10), the soil fraction passing a number 200 sieve (AVG_NO200), and organic matter (AVG_OM). The soil characteristics in the TEXT table are percent sand, silt, and clay (AVG_SAND, AVG_SILT, and AVG_CLAY). The soil characteristics in the WTDEP table are the annual minimum water table depth (WTDEP_MIN), available water storage in the 0-25 cm soil horizon (AWS025), the minimum water table depth for the months April, May and June (WTDEPAMJ), the available water storage in the first 25 centimeters of the soil horizon (AWS25), the dominant drainage class (DRCLSD), the wettest drainage class (DRCLSWET), and the hydric classification (HYDCLASS), which is an indication of the proportion of the map unit, expressed as a class, that is "hydric", based on the hydric classification of a given MUKEY. (See Entity_Description for more detail). The tables were created with a set of arc macro language (aml) and awk (awk was created at Bell Labsin the 1970s and its name is derived from the first letters of the last namesof its authors – Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan) scripts. Send an email to mewieczo@usgs.gov to obtain copies of the computer code (See Process_Description.) The methods used are outlined in NRCS's "SSURGO Data Packaging and Use" (NRCS, 2011). The tables can be related or joined to the gSSURGO rasters of MUKEYs by the item 'MUKEY.' Joining or relating the tables to a MUKEY grid allows the creation of grids of area- and depth-weighted soil characteristics. A 90-meter raster of MUKEYs is provided which can be used to produce rasters of soil attributes. More detailed resolution rasters are available through NRCS via the link above.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c095e4b02acb4f0c92d2.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|The data were derived for use in studies requiring estimates of soil characteristics. The georeferenced soil characteristics were intended to be averaged over large areas, such as over a river basin, and used for (1) watershed simulation models that require spatially lumped estimates of soil hydraulic parameters, and (2) as explanatory variables in regional and national water-quality assessment studies.

The information can be displayed in tables or as maps and is available for most areas in the United States and the Territories, Commonwealths, and Island Nations served by the USDA-NRCS. The information was gathered by walking over the land and observing the soil. Many soil samples were analyzed in laboratories. The maps outline areas called map units. The map units describe soils and other components that have unique properties, interpretations, and productivity. The information was collected at scales ranging from 1:12,000 to 1:63,360. More details were gathered at a scale of 1:12,000 than at a scale of 1:63,360. The mapping is intended for natural resource planning and management by landowners, townships, and counties. Some knowledge of soils data and map scale is necessary to avoid misunderstandings. The maps are linked in the database to information about the component soils and their properties for each map unit. Each map unit may contain one to three major components and some minor components. The map units are typically named for the major components. Examples of information available from the database include available water capacity, soil reaction, electrical conductivity, and frequency of flooding; yields for cropland, woodland, rangeland, and pastureland; and limitations affecting recreational development, building site development, and other engineering uses. SSURGO datasets consist of map data, tabular data, and information about how the maps and tables were created. The extent of a SSURGO dataset is a soil survey area, which may consist of a single county, multiple counties, or parts of multiple counties. SSURGO map data can be viewed in the Web Soil Survey or downloaded in ESRI® Shapefile format. The coordinate systems are Geographic. Attribute data can be downloaded in text format that can be imported into a Microsoft® Access® database.
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c095e4b02acb4f0c92d2.xml|/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc|In order to process soil attributes by soil mapping unit (MUKEY) from the SSURGO database, at least three tables (mapunit, component, and CHORIZON) are needed along with the spatial coverages. These files can be accessed from NRCS (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/geo/?cid=nrcs142p2_053628). All available data were downloaded, processed as outlined below. SSURGO map unit data are stored in the map unit table (MAPUNIT.TXT), and are referenced by the field MUKEY. Map units consist of multiple, unmapped soil types called "components." Component data are stored in the component table (COMP.TXT), and are referenced by the field COKEY. Soil components (or soil type) are associated with multiple horizons. Horizon data are stored in the CHORIZON table (CHORIZON.TXT), and are referenced by the field COKEY. Since there is a one to many (mapunit:component:horizon) relationship between spatial and horizon-level soil property data, two aggregation steps are required in order to produce a thematic map. Deriving MUKEY average values for permeability, available water capacity, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil erodibility, field capacity, porosity, average soil thickness, and organic matter required that a weighted-average value be computed for all the soil horizons in a soil component, and then a weighted-average value was computed for all the soil components in a soil mapping unit. First, the component average values were computed by weighting the layer values by their thickness. Second, the MUKEY average was computed by weighting the component average values by their percentage composition of the MUKEY. Each step of the two-step weighting process was done exactly as described above: first, the layer values were weighted by their thicknesses and then the component values were weighted by their percentage composition. The methods used to derive soil variables were taken from the NRCS's SSURGO Data Packaging and Use (NRCS, 2011, http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/ref/?cid=nrcs142p2_053631). ESRI's ArcInfo Workstation version 9.2 and GNU's awk program version 1.2.0 were used to process all SSURGO files. A weighted average of the soil property value for all components in the map unit is used to attribute the map unit for that soil property. Percent composition is used as the weighting factor. This aggregation method is only suitable for numerical attributes. If the soil property being aggregated is an attribute of a soil horizon, then a single value for all included horizons must be determined for each component before computing a weighted average for all components. In this case, the single component value is also computed as a weighted average, where the weighting factor for each horizon is its percentage of the depth range in question. In the following example, a weighted-average value for total clay is calculated. Step 1. For each component, a weighted-average value for clay is calculated. Clay = SUM (horizon thickness/total thickness X total clay) for all included soil horizons. Table: component: MUKEY (Mapping Unit) COKEY (component key) Percent of Component* 100017 100017:149541 60 100017 100017:149542 40 Table: CHORIZON COKEY (component key) Horizon Depth Clay 100017:149541 20 9.5 100017:149541 56 12.5 100017:149541 76 1.5 100017:149542 20 9.5 100017:149542 10 11.5 100017:149542 122 3.5 100017:149541 [ ( ( 20/152) *9.5 ) + ( ( 56/152 ) * 12.5 ) + ( ( 76/152 ) * 1.5 ) ] = 6.60 100017:149542 [ ( ( 20/152) *9.5 ) + ( ( 10/152 ) * 11.5 ) + ( ( 122/152 ) * 3.5 ) ]= 4.82 Step 2. For each map unit, a weighted-average value for total clay in the upper 50 centimeters (cm) or less of the soil is calculated. Total Clay in the Upper 50 cm (or less) = SUM (percent composition* Total Clay in the Upper 50 cm (or less) for all components in the map unit mukey Total Clay in the Upper 50 cm (or less) 100017:149541 .60 * 6.60 = 3.96 100017:149542 .40 * 4.82 = 1.93 10017 = 3.96 + 1.93 = 5.89 * SSURGO is often an incomplete database and at times, the component percentages do not add up to 100 for a MUKEY. When components do not add up to 100, the following calculation is used to ensure that the components are treated as 100% Table: component: MUKEY (Mapping Unit) COKEY (component key) Percent of Component 100017 100017:149541 60 100017 100017:149542 30 100017:149541 60 / (60 + 30 ) = 66.66 Percent of Component 100017:149542 30 / (60 + 30 ) = 33.33 Percent of Component MUKEYs where components did not add up to 100% were flagged accoding to the following criteria (NRCS, written communic. 3/2014): 95 - 105 data were deemed reliable. Less than 95 data were deemed unreliable. Greater than 105 data were deemed suspect. Each soil attribute in this table was processed this way except for vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity (KV) and porosity (POR). Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KV) was calculated the following way: KV = d / sum ( di / Ki ) where KV is the vertical conductivity; d is the total soil thickness = sum (di); di is the thickness of layer i; and Ki is the permeability of layer i (found in the SSURGO table CHORIZON; KSAT_R which is the saturated hydraulic conductivity). Porosity (POR) was calculated the following way: POR = 1 - [( bulk density) / (particle density)] where bulk density is the item wthirdbar_r found in the SSURGO table CHORIZON. particledensity is the item partdensity found in the SSURGO table CHORIZON.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c096e4b02acb4f0c92da.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The egg-mat data describe a sub-set of the egg-mat network operated by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. The sub-set inlcudes two sites, 1. near an area commonly known as Shorty's Island, and 2. near the Kootenai River confluence with Myrtle Creek at an area commonly known as Myrtle Bend. The egg-mats consist of artificial substrate mats that are deployed and retrieved every 24-48 hours by IDFG personnel. The egg-mat material is designed to trap eggs that come in contact with the mat, allow personnel to quanitify the number of eggs for the deployed period. The egg-mat data is described by date, quantity of eggs retrieved, and the spatial location (geographic and projected coordinates).
52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c096e4b02acb4f0c92da.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose|These data are intended to be combined with bathymetric, surficial sediment facies, and streamflow characteristics to describe the physical habitat occupied by Kootenai River white sturgeon during spawning and early-life phases. These data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) or other software to display the Kootenai River White Sturgeon Egg-Mat Network near Shorty's Island and Myrtle Bend operated by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c096e4b02acb4f0c92da.xml|/metadata/dataqual/posacc/horizpa/horizpar|The positional accuracy of the egg-mat data was not verified. Numerous points were deleted that did not fall within the extent of the riverine area. These data are believed to have been recorded erroneously, either by human error or positioning error from the GPS. The average horizontal uncertainty of the egg-mats, based on positional uncertainties of hand-held mapping grade GPS units, is around 3-10 meters. Additional positional uncertainty, such as movement caused by drifting in the current, is unknown but thought to be within the error of the GPS (3-10 meters).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c10ee4b02acb4f0c93a4.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|Water levels in 93 wells completed in the Wood River Valley aquifer system were measured during October 22–24, 2012; these wells are part of a network established by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2006. Maps of the October 2012 water-table altitude in the unconfined aquifer and the potentiometric-surface altitude of the confined aquifer have similar topology to those on maps of October 2006 conditions. Between October 2006 and October 2012, water-table altitude in the unconfined aquifer rose by as much as 1.86 feet in 6 wells and declined by as much as 14.28 feet in 77 wells; average decline was 2.9 feet. From October 2006 to October 2012, the potentiometric-surface altitude in 10 wells completed in the confined aquifer declined between 0.12 and 20.50 feet; average decline was 6.8 feet.

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c10fe4b02acb4f0c93ac.xml|/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract|The High Plains aquifer extends from south of 32 degrees to almost 44 degrees north latitude and from 96 degrees 30 minutes to 104 degrees west longitude. The aquifer underlies about 175,000 square miles in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. This dataset consists of a raster of water-level changes for the High Plains aquifer, predevelopment (about 1950) to 2013. This digital dataset was created using water-level measurements from 3,349 wells measured in both the predevelopment period (about 1950) and in 2013 and using other published information on water-level change in areas with few water-level measurements. The map was reviewed for consistency with the relevant data at a scale of 1:1,000,000.

The accuracy of the water-level measurements can be affected by many factors; if there is oil on the surface of the water, the error in the water-level measurement could be as much as 5 ft, depending on the depth of the oil. The accuracy of the water-level change value for a given cell is dependent on the proximity of cell to measured wells. The average, median, and maximum distance between wells, which were measured in predevelopment and in 2013, is 3.2 miles, 2.7 miles, and 20.1 miles, respectively. In the area of water-level changes from a decline of 5 ft to a rise of 5 ft, the cell's water-level change value was set to zero because of uncertainty in the interpolation of water-level changes less than 5 ft, especially in areas with few measured wells.

The average, median, and maximum distance between wells, which were measured in predevelopment and in 2013, is 3.2 miles, 2.7 miles, and 20.1 miles, respectively. The interpolation process uses the water-level change value from measured wells and other supporting data. For cells collocated with measured well(s), the interpolation process results in cell values that are generally similar to, but commonly not equal to, the calculated values for the measured well(s).

52824fe6e4b08f1425d6e23c|5488c10fe4b02acb4f0c93ac.xml|/metadata/eainfo/overview/eaover|This floating-point raster dataset represent water-level change in the High Plains aquifer from predevelopment to 2013, in ft. The maximum and minimum value of the raster is -255.96 ft to 82.53 ft. The measured values for water-level changes, predevelopment to 2013, ranged from a decline of 256 ft for a well in Texas to a rise of 85 ft for a well in Nebraska. The interpolation process used to generate the rasters referred to in this report results in cell values, for cells collocated with a measured well, that are generally similar to, but commonly not exactly equal to, the corresponding values based on those water-level measurements. The cell values represent the value for an area 500 meters by 500 meters and the measured values are point values within the area represented by the cell.
