         <abstract>This dataset is the digital hydrologic unit boundary layer for the 8-digit subwatershed boundaries for the conterminous United States. This dataset is intended to be used with the following two tabular dBase files:  http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?ds573_tillage_lu92e and http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?ds573_tillage_lu01. The two tabular datasets contain the Tillage Practices in the Conterminous United States, 1989-2004---Datasets Aggregated by Watershed. This dataset and the two tabular datasets can be linked using the common attribute HUC8_N. Information about how the tabular data and geospatial data can be related are given in the data series report: http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/ds573/ .The original dataset is the 12-digit Subwatershed boundaries (WBD_archive_17nov2009_9.2_file). The 12-digit boundaries were dissolved to 8-digit boundaries to be used with the two tabular .dbase data files containing the tillage practice data for the United States. 
			
			 ORIGINAL METADATA: This data set is a complete digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the entire United States. This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the "Federal Guidelines, Requirements, and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset; Chapter 3 of Section A, Federal Standards, Book 11, Collection and Delineation of Spatial Data; Techniques and Methods 11-A3" (04/01/2009). http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/watershed/index.html . Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 4th level sub-basins, 5th level watersheds, 6th level subwatersheds, name, size, downstream hydrologic unit, type of watershed, non-contributing areas and flow modification.</abstract>
         <purpose>The Watershed and Subwatershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. The smaller sized 6th level sub-watersheds (up to 250,000 acres) are useful for numerous application programs supported by a variety of local, State, and Federal Agencies. This data set is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. The dataset is seamless and, for the most part, a nationally consistant geospatial database.</purpose>

      <useconst>The distributor shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in the U.S.A. The NRCS should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The Watershed Boundary Dataset is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application of the data. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions they make.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of the data.  If enlarged, the maps will not include the fine detail that would be appropriate for mapping at the small scale.  Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data from the source distributor.</useconst>

      <logic>There are no unclosed polygons, intersections without nodes, or polygons without labels or with more than one label. The ArcGIS geodatabase topology tools were used to make corrections using 11 rules including no gaps, no overlaps, identify cooresponding linework for every polygon boundary, and remove duplicate lines with the same beginning and ending nodes.</logic>

         <horizpa>
            <horizpar>The WBD was produced using Digital Raster Graphics (DRG's) as the source map. Data completeness for DRG files reflects content of the source graphic and may therefore be reflected in the completeness and accuracy of the WBD. The map was digitized from USGS 1:24,000-scale digital raster graphic base maps, with an inherited error of +/- 40 feet according to the USGS National Map Accuracy Standards.
It is estimated that any errors detected were less than 10%. It should also be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used (i.e. natural water flow is downhill), the locations of boundaries is still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale DRG's do not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries.</horizpar>

            <procdesc>The new WBD dataset was reviewed on-screen by USGS, EPA, or NRCS personnel using DRG's and DOQ?s as base maps. Hydrologic Units that were under 10,000 acres (for the 12-digit units) and 40,000 acres (for the 10-digit units) were reviewed and if possible were dissolved out. Along the coastal areas classic watersheds that fell within the federal guidelines size criteria (12-digit: 10,000-40,000 acres, 10-digit: 40,000-250,000 acres) were broken out. If possible the remaining frontals were left as their own units. Frontals that did not meet the size criteria were grouped together with other frontals within the overall 8-digit or 10-digit unit.
Hydrologic units what were greater than 40,000 acres (12-digit units) and 250,000 acres (10-digit units) were reviewed. If possible these unit where then broken down into smaller units that met the size criteria. In some cases additional breaks within the unit would not have made sense or have been very useful (example: When the majority of the unit was made up by a major waterbody feature such as a lake or reservoir and the surrounding tributaries were too small to break out as their own unit). In these instances the unit was left big. 	 Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: USGSDRG</procdesc>

      <overview>
         <eaover>Each hydrologic unit polygon has associated attributes stored in 
tabular format. An attribute, also called a field or column, is defined by 
name, type, size, and valid values.  For this layer, these attributes are
the Hydrologic Unit Codes, Names, Acreage, States crossed, non-contributing 
area, Downstream unit code, Type, and Modification.

      <distliab>The distributor shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in the U.S.A.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture makes no claims for the data's suitability for other purposes. U.S. Department of Agriculture should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The Watershed Boundary Dataset is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application of the data. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions they make.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of the data.  If enlarged, the maps will not include the fine detail that would be appropriate for mapping at the small scale.  Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data from the source distributor.</distliab>
