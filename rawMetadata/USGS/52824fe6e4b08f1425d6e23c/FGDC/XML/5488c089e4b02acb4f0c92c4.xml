         <abstract>According to the U.S. Geological Survey, an estimated 258 million people nationwide, or 86% of the U.S. population, relied on public water supplies for their household use in 2005 (USGS, 2013). The remaining population obtains their water from different sources, such as a domestic self-supply well. However, the spatial distribution of water supply systems has not been compiled. Mapping where these people are located can be done within a GIS (Geographic Information System). The approach used takes into account a number of different attributes gathered from the United States Census Bureau for the block group and block shapes within the Delaware River Basin.</abstract>
         <purpose>This dataset shows the geographic distribution of water supply throughout the Delaware River Basin extent. The data is broken down by Census block group shapes for the year 2010. This dataset was developed as part of a U.S. Geological Survey study regarding the water use throughout the Delaware River Basin. It is used to spatially show where the domestic self-supplied water users resided for this Census year.</purpose>

         <procstep>
            <procdesc>Two datasets were relied upon to produce this water use dataset. The U.S. Geological Survey’s National Water-Use Information Program (NWUIP) compiles water use data on a national, regional, state, and county scale. Every five years, population totals and quantitative amounts of water are published in a national circular. It provides a statistical break down of the populations’ water-use into different categories, such as: public supply, commercial use, domestic-self supply, irrigation/agriculture, and thermoelectric (U.S. Geological Survey, 2014). This allows us to see the total sum of people that are obtaining their water from and for these sources. However, not all of the data is pertinent to this study. The most important piece is the category that totals county populations which are being served from a public supply source. The United State Census is a decadal dataset that accounts for an abundance of numerical information. The Census essentially counts every resident that resides in the United States, and tallies up a comprehensive volume of information regarding the population. Data is collected and made available at different scales; such as by state, county, or zip code. The Census also has smaller shapes (block groups and blocks), and these offer the highest resolutions. Spatially, they are the most intricate. The 1990 Census was the only one to include water use information. Typically, the U.S. Census will collect the same information every year, which enables them to show comparisons and changes. However, the 1990 year included more data (water use being one topic) which was made available for the smaller Census shapes. This category of data has not been collected since. The Census data was obtained through a third party organization, National Historical Geographic Information System, and they simplified the data download process.</procdesc>
            <procdate>20130501</procdate>
         </procstep>
         <procstep>
            <procdesc>The results for 1990 are used as the foundation to forecast the public supply areas into future Census years. The 2010 Census did not gather data on water use, so there is no way to calculate a new Housing Units Public Supply Percentage (HU PS%) for this year. However, population data was used to calculate a population density for the block group shapes during this year. Again, the population density, “Pop_Density_Populated_Areas”, looks specifically at the density within the populated areas of the block group. The vacant block areas within the block group were removed. This gives a true representation of the population density within the populated areas of the block group. The calculation for this is "Population" / "Populated_Sq_Miles". The population density will gauge whether a shape flips from domestic to public supply in the future years. As an example, if the population density of a domestic self-supplied block group increases over its Counties’ population density 95th percentile, it would be now be considered publicly supplied. This is caused by a population growth within the block group shape. Keep in mind that the Counties’ 95th percentiles for population density (which was calculated from the 1990 data), will remain that value into the future.</procdesc>
            <procdate>20130501</procdate>
         </procstep>
         <procstep>
            <procdesc>When projecting the years after 1990, the prior time period is used as a starting point. So, all block groups that are publicly supplied in 2000 must also be that for the year 2010. A public supply area would never switch to domestic self-supply. Once a block group is classified as public supply, it will always be that, regardless if the population density decreases over the following Census year. The one issue was that the actual shapes of the block group had changed from the 2000 to 2010 Census. It was hard to ensure that all public supply block group shapes in 2000 were being reflected as such in 2010. The remedy to this was applying a select by center operation. Using ArcMap, you can create a new selection based upon a previously selected set. The block groups for 2010 were deemed public supply if the center of their shape falls within the boundaries of a public supply block group in 2000. Knowing that public supply areas will always remain public supply as a whole, the only shapes that can differ between time periods are the domestic self-supplied areas in 2000. If the population density of the 2010 Census block group shapes in these locations increase over their Counties’ 95th percentile, they would be flipped to public supply. This in turn shows an expansion of public supply areas over the ten year period.</procdesc>
            <procdate>20130501</procdate>
         </procstep>
         <procstep>
            <procdesc>Lastly, the Delaware River Basin extent cuts through the middle of many Counties. After the water source for each block group shape has been identified (throughout the entire County), those block groups that do not intersect the boundary extent are removed from the coverage. These block groups are not part of the study. However, they need to be included within the approach because the NWUIP is summing public supply population based on entire Counties. They play a role when looking at Counties as a whole, but are simply removed at the end.</procdesc>
