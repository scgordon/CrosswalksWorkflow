The current interdisciplinary research integrates ecological and socioeconomic components across 54,000 km2 of the southern Appalachian Mountains, a biogeophysical and socioeconomic region in which evolutionary and historical processes converge (Whittaker 1956, Markusen 1987, Barnes 1991, Kretzschmar et al. 1993, Bailey 1996). Our research objective in 2002-2008 is to advance scientific understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years. Our guiding hypothesis is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in response to socioeconomic and biogeophysical conditions with consequences that cascade through ecosystems.</para></abstract><funding><para>This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number OCE-9982133.
