      <literalLayout>Grassland: The sampling locations for the grassland habitat are located along the road between Black Butte and 5-Points. Stations are numbered as follows, from north to south: 146, 147, 140, 141 142, 143, 144 and 145.  All stakes are located&#160; on the east side of the road. As one drives south from Black Butte, Station #138 (changed to 146 in the spring of 1995 because old tag lost) is located 1.2 miles south of the road intersection immediately east of Black Butte.  Stations are then located at 0.5 mile intervals.  There are eight total stations.Creosote: The sampling locations for the creosote shrubland are located on or near the road that runs along the north rim of&#160; Palo Duro Canyon (east and west of 5-points).  Stakes are numbered from #130 through #137, and are located on the north side of the road.  Stake locations are as follows: #130  West of 5-points at Pipeline Road; mileage = 0.0 #131  Heading east, site is on road; mileage = 0.3 #132  Heading east, site is on road; mileage = 0.6 #133  Turn south on "Neck  Road", site is on road (stake is on west side of road); mileage = 1.0 from # 130 #134  Return to main east-west read, turn east and proceed to intersection of road coming from north (the "common garden" road).  Keep going east 0.1 mile, and look for flagged stake on south side of road.  Sample point is 200 meters south of road near the tall "A-100" rebar post of the rodent trapping web. #135  At 5-points, in the center of the triangle formed by the three main roads.  Flagged stake is on the east-west road, north side.  Sample point is 50 meters north of road.  Zero odometer here for next two stations. #136  Proceed east on road 0.3 miles from #135.  Flagged stake in on north side of road, and sample point is 50 meters north of road. #137  Proceed east on road 0.7 miles from # 135.  Flagged stake is on north side of road.  Sample point is on road.Pinyon-Juniper: Sample locations are in Goat Draw.  All sample points are off the main road, on high ground to one side or the other. Flagged stakes mark parking positions on road, and flagged, numbered stakes mark sampling points.  Stations are numbered from #121 in the lower canyon to #129 in the upper canyon.  There are nine total staions (eight regular stations and one station at the Goat Draw well site).  Odometer is zeroed at sign-in box near entrance gate. Stake locations are as follows: #121  Mileage = 0.7  Sample location is on hill to west. #122  Mileage = 1.3  Goat Draw Well.  Sample location is on small hill west of well near house ruins. #123  Mileage = 1.7  Sample location is on hill to west. #124  Mileage = 2.2  Sample location is on hill to west. #125  Mileage = 2.7  Sample location is on hill to west. #126  Mileage = 3.35 Sample location is to the east of road on ridgetop. #127  Mileage = 3.7  Sample location is on top of hill by road. #128  Mileage = 4.3  Sample location is at Meteorological Station approximately 150 meters to the west. #129  Mileage = 4.7  Sample location is on hill to north (right side of road).Here is a list of the AOU codes   used:	AOU#	Common Name	293   - Scaled Quail	295   - Gambel's Quail	309.1 - Ring-necked Pheasant	316   - Mourning Dove 	331   - Northern Harrier	332   - Sharp-shinned Hawk	333   - Cooper's Hawk                	337   - Red-tailed Hawk           	360   - American Kestrel             	342   - Swainson's Hawk	348   - Ferruginous Hawk 	375   - Great Horned Owl             	396   - Ladder-backed Woodpecker     	413   - Red-shafted Flicker          	418   - Common Poorwill	420   - Common Nighthawk 	421   - Lesser Nighthawk            	432   - Broad-tailed Hummingbird     	447   - Western Kingbird 	448   - Cassin's Kingbird	454   - Ash-throated Flycatcher        	457   - Say's Phoebe        	467.9 - unidentified Empidonax sp.	474   - Horned Lark	481   - Scrub Jay       	486   - Common Raven                 	492   - Pinyon Jay    	495   - Brown-headed Cowbird            	501   - Eastern Meadowlark	501.1 - Western Meadowlark            	504   - Scott's Oriole 	508   - Bullock's Oriole	519   - House Finch                 	520   - Pine Siskin	530   - Lesser Goldfinch               	538   - Chestnut-collared  Longspur	539   - McCown's Longspur           	540   - Vesper Sparrow         	552   - Lark Sparrow               	559   - American Tree Sparrow	560   - Chipping Sparrow               	562   - Brewer's Sparrow	567.7 - Dark-eyed Sparrow (Junco)	573   - Black-throated Sparrow	574   - Sage Sparrow	578   - Cassin's Sparrow	581   - Song Sparrow	587   - Rufous-sided Towhee	590   - Green-tailed Towhee	591   - Brown Towhee	596   - Black-headed Grosbeak	597   - Blue Grosbeak	605   - Lark Bunting	607   - Western Tanager	612   - Cliff Swallow	615   - Violet-green Swallow	616   - Bank Swallow	617   - Rough-winged Swallow	622   - Loggerhead Shrike	629   - Solitary Vereo	655   - Yellow-rumped Warbler	668   - Townsend's Warbler	680   - MacGillivray's Warbler	702   - Sage Thrasher	703   - Northern Mockingbird	705   - Brown Thrasher	708   - Bendire's Thrasher	713   - Cactus Wren	715   - Rock Wren	719   - Bewick's Wren	721   - House Wren	727   - White-breasted Nuthatch	728   - Red-breasted Nuthatch	733   - Plain Titmouse	735   - Black-capped Chickadee	738   - Mountain Chickadee	743   - Bushtit	749   - Ruby-crowned Kinglet	751   - Blue-gray Gnatcatcher	754   - Townsend's Solitaire	761   - American Robin	767   - Western Bluebird	768   - Mountain Bluebird</literalLayout>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Black Butte Mixed Grass site is located just inside the gate and to the south of Black Butte. This site is grassland, characterized by Oryzopsis hymenoides, Sporobolus giganteus, Sporobolus flexuosus, Bouteloua eriopoda, and occasional shrubs, including Gutierrezia sarothrae and Yucca glauca.&#160; Forbs include Senecio douglasii, Baileyi multiradiata, and Sphaeralcea spp. This site contains the fertilizer study plots, which are located less than one mile from the Black Butte gate on the east side of the road to Five Points.Landform: Basalt formation., Vegetation: Grasses include blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), black grama (B. eriopoda), galleta grass (Pleuraphis jamesii), dropseed (Sporobolus spp.), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), and burro grass (Scleropogon brevifolius).  Creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) also occurs frequently. , siteid: 47</geographicDescription>

          <para>
            <literalLayout>Data was collected from 1991 through 1997.&#160; Each habitat was sampled on a single morning in winter, spring, summer, and fall, totalling three sampling efforts per year per site. Sampling was done in the last two weeks of February, May, August, and December.&#160;  Year-to-year variation likely affected bird patterns relative to the schedule, but these dates generally enabled an accurate sampling of species richness and abundance.  Weather permitting, each of the three habitats were surveyed over three  consecutive days.&#160; Unseasonable conditions, windy mornings (7+ mph), and  rain were avoided. Bird densities were sampled using a Variable Circular Plot Census technique. There were eight sampling locations in each of the three habitat types. (However, the sampling design did not include replication, and, therefore, estimates of density should be considered tentative.)&#160; At each sampling location the observer stood at a stake for nine minutes and scanned for bird activity.  All individuals seen and/or heard within a 200 meter radius were recorded.&#160; For each bird observation these variables were recorded:  species ID (according to the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU)), estimated distance from sampling location in meters, cardinal direction, and detection mode (sight or sound).  The observer also tallied individuals flying over a sample area and included these in the data.  Additional birds observed while travelling between sampling locations were noted but not included in the data set.&#160; Finally, weather conditions at the beginning and end of each daily sample were recorded.  This included an estimate of wind speed (mph) and cloud cover (using an eight-point scale: 0 (clear) to 8 (completely overcast)), and a measurement of temperature.</literalLayout>
