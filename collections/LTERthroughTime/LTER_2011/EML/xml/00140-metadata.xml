    <section>
      <para>This study measured the population dynamics of black-tail jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) and desert cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus auduboni) in the grasslands and creosote shrublands of McKenzie Flats, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge.&#160; The study was begun in January, 1992, and continued quarterly each year.&#160; Rabbits were sampled via night-time spotlight transect sampling along the roads of McKenzie Flats during winter, spring, summer, and fall of each year.&#160; The entire road transect was 21.5 miles in length. Measurements of perpendicular distance of each rabbit from the center of the road were used to estimate densities (number of rabbits per square kilometer) via Program DISTANCE.&#160; Results from 1992 to 2002 indicated that spring was the peak density period of the year, with generally steady declines through the year until the following spring. Evidence of a long-term "cycle" (e.g., the 11 year cycle reported for rabbits in the Great Basin Desert) did not appear in the Sevilleta rabbit populations.</para>

    <geographicCoverage>
      <geographicDescription>Location: McKenzie Flats is located within the northeastern section of the Sevilleta NWR, encompassing an area from Black Butte south  to Palo Duro Canyon and east to the Los Pinos.Landform: McKenzie Flats is a broad, nearly flat grassland plain between the Los Pinos Mountains and the breaks on the east side of the Rio Grande., Geology: Deep (20,000 ft) alluvial and aeolian deposits., Soils: Turney Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Calciorthids.  Berino Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids., Hydrology: Surface water only during rain events, no arroyos.  Run-on plain for Los Pinos Mountains., Vegetation: The terrain is generally a mixed-species desert grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), blue grama (B. gracilis), sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola), various drop seeds and sacatons (Sporobolus spp.), purple three-awn (Aristida purpurea), and burrow grass (Scleropogon brevifolia).  Shrubs are common in the area around Five Points, including creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)., Climate: Long-term mean annual precipitation is 243 mm, about 60% of which occurs during the summer.  Long-term mean monthly temperatures for January and July are 1.5 degrees C and 25.1 degrees C, respectively., History: McKenzie Flats encompasses an area of approximately 50 square miles and was one of the primary livestock grazing areas within what is now the Sevilleta NWR.  Cattle have been excluded from the site since 1974-76.  The ranch headquarters buildings and corrals were located at the junction of Legs C and D of the coyote survey.  , siteid: 25</geographicDescription>

  <purpose>
    <para>
      <literalLayout>The purpose of the study was to assess the dynamics of rabbit populations in the grasslands and creosote shrublands of the Sevilleta NWR.&#160; Rabbits are important herbivores in these habitats, and can influence NPP and plant species composition.&#160; In turn, these animals also provide high-quality prey for many of the Sevilleta's mammal and reptile carnivores and birds of prey.&#160; Density data on rabbits can be used to calculate herbivore pressure on the plant communities.</literalLayout>

          <para>
            <literalLayout>When the samples were collected: The samples were collected in winter, spring, summer, and fall, of each year.&#160; Rabbit populations were sampled during a single night during each of these four seasons per year.&#160; Dates of collection varied in some years, but generally the sampling was conducted in January, April, July, and October.Sampling Design: The rabbits were sampled along 21.5 miles of roadway that was broken up into four "legs" of varying lengths.Leg A: &#160;Black Butte southward to Five Points (5.7 miles).Leg B:&#160; Five Points eastward to the turnoff before Palo Duro Canyon (4.1 miles).Leg C:&#160; Palo Duro turnoff northward to the old McKenzie Headquarters site (6.1 miles).Leg D:&#160; McKenzie Headquarters site northwestward to Black Butte (5.6 miles).Measurement Techniques: The rabbit surveys were conducted at night using spotlights. Surveys began one hour after sunset, when no trace of sunlight or dusk remained.&#160; Beginning in 1998, samples were taken only during full-moon periods. A pickup truck was driven slowly (8-10 miles per hour) along the road of the 21.5 mile circuit.&#160; Two (or more) observers stood in the bed of the pickup truck, and scanned the left and right sides (respectively) of the road with spotlights, while the driver kept watch for rabbits directly in front in the road.&#160; During 1992, the spotlights were Q-Beam 500,000 candlepower spotting lights, with both flood and spot settings (spot settings were used during the rabbit sampling).&#160; From 1993 through 1996, Q-Beam spotlights with 1,000,000 candlepower were used.&#160; In 1997, new spotlights with 3,000,000 candlepower were used; these lights were set permanently on "flood", but illuminated well at distances previously reached by the spot settings of the less-powerful spotlights. &#160;In addition to the spotlights used by the standing observers in the bed of the pickup truck, two spotlights mounted on the pillar posts of the truck's cab were turned on and set for the roadsides ahead of the truck; these lights, coupled with the high-beam setting of the truck's headlights, illuminated the road in front of the truck for approximately 100 meters. When a rabbit was observed, one person's spotlight illuminated the spot at which the rabbit was first seen.&#160; The second person's spotlight would track the rabbit, so that it was not counted twice.&#160; A meter tape was walked out from the center of the truck bed (which equalled the center of the road) in a perpendicular direction from the road to the location at which the rabbit was first observed.&#160; That distance was measured and recorded to the nearest meter.If a rabbit was observed in the middle of the road, the distance was recorded as zero.&#160; Beginning in January, 2000, perpendicular distances to the rabbits were taken with a laser range finder, with accuracies of less than 1 meter (accuracies were tested before field use and confirmed to be 10 per leg), the difference legs were analyzed separately, and the resulting mean densities were estimated by averaging the four leg estimates.&#160; In the results tables below, these instances are indicated by the category, "MEAN".&#160; If sample sizes were too small to estimate the four legs separately, then all the rabbit observations were pooled together, and a density estimate for the entire 21.5 mile survey was calculated. These results are indicated by the category, "ALL".</literalLayout>
