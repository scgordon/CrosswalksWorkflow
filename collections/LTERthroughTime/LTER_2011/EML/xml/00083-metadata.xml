    <section>
      <para>In 2005, annually harvested root ingrowth donut structures were co-located with previously established mini-rhizotron tubes established at four sites on McKenzie Flats located on the east side of Sevilleta NWR: 10 replicate structures in both burned and unburned blue and black grama dominated grassland plots at Deep Well, 10 replicates each on nitrogen fertilization plots and respective control plots on McKenzie Flats(20 total), 10 replicates in creosote dominated shrubland at the Five Points Creosote Core site and in 2011, 13 structures were put in the Monsoon site.  Roots and soil are harvested annually in late fall after the growing season, and structures are reestablished in situ for consecutive harvests each year. Each structure allows roots to be harvested at two depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm) to estimate root production, or below ground net primary productivity. In order to compare estimates of root production from two methods, root ingrowth donuts were collocated with mini-rhizotron tubes at all localities except for the burned grassland plot at Deep Well.</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Deep Well is located on McKenzie Flats and is site of the longest running SEV LTER met station, number 40, which has been active since 1988.&#160; In addition to studies of meteorological variables, core line-intercept vegetation transects and line-intercept transects from the 1995 and 2001 Deep Well fires are sampled here.&#160; The mini-rhizotron study, blue and black grama compositional comparison, blue and black grama patch dynamics investigation, and kangaroo rat population assessement are all ongoing here.&#160; Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is also the location of the warming and monsoon experiments, as well as portions of the line-intercept and vegetation removal studies.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the area of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed.&#160; While portions of this site were burned, the entirety was not.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the fire.Vegetation: The vegetation of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and blue grama (B. gracilis).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Five Points area emcompasses both the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote study sites.&#160; Five Points falls along the transition between the Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats.&#160; Both core sites are subject to intensive research activities, including NPP measurements, phenology observations, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments.&#160; There are rain-out shelters for drought studies in both the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote sites.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosote overstory, with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (Opuntia macrocentra), and soapweed yucca as co-occurring shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous, dense, grass-dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama Site.  Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bushmuhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii).  Notable forbs include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea spp.)., siteid: 3</geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Experimental Design Annually harvested root ingrowth donut structures are co-located with previously established mini-rhizotron tubes established at four sites on the McKenzie Flats on the east side of Sevilleta NWR: 10 replicate structures in both burned and unburned blue and black grama dominated grassland plots at Deep Well, 10 replicates each on nitrogen fertilization plots and respective control plots on McKenzie Flats (20 total), and 10 replicates in creosote dominated shrubland at the Five Points Creosote Core site. Methods were adapted from Milchunas et al (2005). We use a formidable 10 diameter soil core to create cylindrical holes in the ground to a depth of 30cm without disturbing soil profile at the cylinder walls. The soil core was inserted with a slide hammer and had to be removed each time with a come-along mounted on a steel-pipe tripod. Walls were subsequently lined with plastic cross-stitch craft work canvas (macram mesh) which supports cylinder walls through time but allows roots to pass through. Two pieces of 6 diameter PVC were placed in the center of the larger cylindrical hole, set in place with bags filled with sand that act as ballasts. The two pieces of PVC were beveled on opposite ends to fit together and prevent movement of the donut center. The top cylinder went to a depth of 15 cm and the bottom piece went to a depth of 30 cm, representing 0-15 and 15-30 cm in the soil profile when stacked upon one another. Finally, sifted soil from the location was used to fill the space between the plastic canvas lining the hole wall and the PVC pipe placed in the center. It is this soil which is harvested annually at two depths. A PVC cap was placed on top of the PVC to eliminate water infiltration from rain through the donut center and to keep sunlight from disintegrating the sand bag ballast. All root ingrowth donuts were GPSed. Sample Harvest  Root donuts are harvested annually in November after the growing season. Roots are harvested by first removing the sand bags from the top cylinder and placing a bowl into the center of the cylinder. The top cylinder is then removed. Soil and roots are cut away from the cylinder wall and collected. This harvest procedure is then repeated for the lower half of the donut structure. Soil and roots collected are placed in a separate plastic bag for each depth. Once the soil and roots are harvested, the root ingrowth structure is rebuilt. After harvest, soil and root samples are stored in a chest freezer until they can be processed. Sample Processing The total volume of soil from each sample is measured and recorded.  Soils are filtered through a series of sieves in which to harvest the roots present in the sample. The roots are then repeatedly rinsed  to remove all the soil from the sample, dried at 60 degrees C, and then weighed.</literalLayout>
