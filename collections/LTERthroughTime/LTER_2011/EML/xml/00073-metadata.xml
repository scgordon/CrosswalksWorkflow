This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword keywordType="theme">Biodiversity</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Climatic Variation</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Disturbance Patterns</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Ecology</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Ecosystem functioning</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Fire Frequency</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Long Term</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Nitrogen limitation</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Nutrient Budgets</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Nutrient Cycles</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Plant Competition</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Primary Productivity</keyword><keyword keywordType="theme">Successional dynamics</keyword></keywordSet><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage id="geoReferenceID" scope="document"><geographicDescription>The Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

This firebreak is then reinforced by wetting the cropped vegetation with a high pressure water hose attached to a 125 gallon water tank. A backfire is started to widen the firebreak. A drip torch is then used to start the groups of plots (one at a time) on fire. For a list of burn treatments for each plot, see file trmte98.

Experiments 5, 6, 28, 36,53,97, 98 and 100 are conducted within plots that are fertilized and should be treated as part of the fertilized plot.  There are nine treatment levels, assigned a letter A through I. This is also equivalent to the numeric labels 1 to 9. Treatment levels A through H differ in the amount of NH4NO3 added. Treatment I is a true control and receives no nutrients. The nutrients are applied twice a year, once in early May and once in late June. An exception is experiment 25 where time of application is experimentally manipulated. Not all experiments  use all possible treatments. Nutrients are given in g/m2 for each fertilization; plot area and treatments used follow the nutrient lists. 
 
Treatment A to H receive the following base nutrients: 
	 	 	 
Rate  	Volume  	Element 
10 g/m2  	150 ml  	P2O5 (0-46-0) 
10 g/m2  	150 ml  	K2O (0-0-61) 
20 g/m2  	200 ml  	CaCO3 (lime) 
15m2  	200 ml  	MgSO4 (Epsom Salts) 
0.0625 ml/m2  	trace mineral solution in 1 ml to 10 ml sand	 	 	 
 
The description for making trace mineral sand is at the end of this section. 
 
The amount of NH4NO3 fertilizer added at the different treatment levels is: 
	 	 	 
Treatment  	Rate  	Volume 
A  	0.0 g/m2  	0 ml 
B  	1.5 g/m2  	25 ml 
C  	3.0 g/m2  	50 ml 
D  	5.0 g/m2  	90 ml 
E  	8.0 g/m2  	140 ml 
F  	14.0 g/m2  	250 ml 
G  	25.0 g/m2  	445 ml 
H  	40.0 g/m2  	710 ml 
I  	0.0 g/m2  	0 ml	 	 	 
 
These rates are added twice a year. Actual annual N addition is calculated as: 
 
0.34%N * rate (g/m2) * 2 times/year 
 
The trace mineral stock solutions are made by adding the following grams of reagent to 1000 ml of water: 
 
CuSO4*5H2O 9.8 g 
ZnSO4*7H2O 22.0 g 
or 
ZnCl2 10.5 g 
CoCl2*6H2O 10.0 g 
MnCl2*4H2O 180.0 g 
Na2MoO4*2H2O 6.3 g 
H3BO3 6.0 g 
 
The trace metal solution is made by combining 120ml of each stock solution, adding 67.2g of citric acid dissolved in deionized water and adding deionized water to bring the volume to a total of 2 liters. The working solution is then autoclaved to chelate the trace metals.
