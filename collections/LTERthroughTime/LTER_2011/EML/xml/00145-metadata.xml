    <section>
      <para>The 100,000 ha Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in central New  Mexico lies in a transition zone that straddles several major biomes of  the Southwest, including Great Basin Shrub-Steppe, Mogollon  Pinon-Juniper Woodland, Great Plains Grassland and Chihuahuan Desert.  During 9 years, (1990-1998), collaborating with the University of New  Mexico's Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, 3,235 rodents (28  species in 4 families) were collected and identified from permanent  collecting sites on the 3 major habitat types (grassland,  desert/creosote, woodland) on the SNWR. Hosts were necropsied for  endoparasites (protozoa [coccidia], helminths) and some ectoparasites.  We identified and analyzed all the parasites found in these hosts. By  1998, we had in place the means to easily identify and moniter the  parasites from all mammalian hosts caught on the LTER Phase II grant.This  is not just another parasite survey; the data we collected was unique  for several reasons: 1) This was the first complete inventory of a  natural assemblage of parasites from all mammalian (rodent) hosts in 3  different communities, each from a distinctly defined geographic  locality (habitat type) over the period of a decade, and beyond; 2) This  study was part of a multidisciplinary approach to address conceptual  issues of climate change on ecosystem structure and function at multiple  scales (individuals, communities, etc) and correlative data from these  related studies will strengthen and contribute to the robustness of this  data set; 3) As the only parasite study on any of the LTER projects  nationwide, it provided an ideal model, and perhaps incentive for  parallel longterm studies of parasite communities to be examined in a  variety of other habitat types, and from a variety of different  perspectives, and other LTER sites in the network.Upon  completing the work, we were able to use these long-term data to try to  understand the dynamics of natural host-parasite assemblages. Hypotheses  were then erected to test/address at least these questions: How do the  different parasite communities colonize, mature, climax and senesce over  time (or do they?), Do they vary in response to abiotic (climate  change) and/or biotic (dispersal, colonization) factors? What temporal  and spatial scales, and among what kinds of organisms, do coevolutionary  processes influence the community organization of these parasites?  Studies of the dynamics of multiple, coexisting species are confined  primarily to microtine rodents and have hinted that multiannual cycles  tend to be synchronous (Brown and Heske 1990). Are similar patterns seen  for the parasites of our desert rodents? Answers to these questions  relating to community structure, as well as to questions concerning  parasite biodiversity on the SNWR, can be answered paritially or  completely by the information we gathered on the parasite species  infecting rodents collected on the SNWR. Initial emphasis of our work  was on identifying all the parasites collected, by processing 8  consecutive years of parasite data, and on training the undergraduate  and graduate students involved in the art of taxonomy and nomenclature  of parasitic protozoans and helminths,&#160; to supply some of these answers.</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points Black Grama is on the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitat. The site is subject to intensive research activity, including assessments of net primary productivity, phenology, and pollinator diversity, amongst other projects.&#160; It is the site of the unburned black grama (GU) component of the Burn NPP study.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the Five Points Black Grama site.&#160; Portions of this site were burned, but not the entirety.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the burn.
&#160;Vegetation: The Five Points Black Grama site is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda)., </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Five Points area emcompasses both the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote study sites.&#160; Five Points falls along the transition between the Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats.&#160; Both core sites are subject to intensive research activities, including NPP measurements, phenology observations, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments.&#160; There are rain-out shelters for drought studies in both the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote sites.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosote overstory, with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (Opuntia macrocentra), and soapweed yucca as co-occurring shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous, dense, grass-dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama Site.  Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bushmuhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii).  Notable forbs include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea spp.)., siteid: 3</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral  tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR,  flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and  Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and  ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites.  Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although  rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site  because the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are  co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location Met Station 44.The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power 	lines.&#160;  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the 	met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.&#160;Vegetation: The Rio Salado Larrea site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), with honey mesquite, fourwing saltbush, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra), and broom snakeweed as co-occurring shrubs. Dominant grasses are black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), and fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum). Common forb species include desert holly (Acourtia nana), spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa spp.), blackfoot daisey (Melampodium leucanthum), twinleaf (Senna bauhinoides), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala). While individual creosote bushes tend to be larger, overall plant cover is less than at the creosote core site at Five Points, with more exposed embedded stones and gravel on the soil surface, creating a pavement-like appearance., </geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Web Trapping DesignSmall mammal densities  were estimated by utilizing the following web design: Within each  location 5 webs are established.  Each web contains 12 100 m transects  radiating from a central point in spoke-like fashion.  Pieces of  rebar,  placed vertically in the ground, are used to mark the location and  maintain permanency of trap placement, and each rebar is numbered  (1-145).  Four Sherman traps (model XLF15 and SFAL, H.B. Sherman Traps,  Tallahassee, FL) are placed around the center stake of the web  (numbered 145) and 12 traps are placed along each of the 12 spokes of  the web, the first 4 at 5 m intervals and the remaining 8 placed at 10 m  intervals. Trap number 1 is on the spoke facing due north and radiating  out from the&#160; center to trap number 12; the remaining 11 spokes follow  with successive numbers increasing in a clockwise fashion.  Traps are  placed adjacent to rebar or in the nearest shaded area found within a 1 m  radius from that rebar.  The webs in any habitat type are seperated  from each other by distances ranging from 100-600 m.Web DescriptionAt  each habitat location, 2 webs are designated as "removal" webs.  The  other 3 webs are "mark-and-recapture" webs.  Each web is numbered from 1  to 5.

Sepultura Canyon (septulur)2.  Five Points Grassland (5pgrass)3.  Five Points Larrea (5plarrea)4.  Rio Salado Larrea (rslarrea)5.  Rio Salado Grassland (rsgrass)6.  Two-twenty-two (two22) currently: Ladron Foothills&#160;Collection Procedures:Mark-and-recapture websA small handful of rolled oats is placed into each trap, with an additional small amount of oats placed outside the trap door when it is set in the evening.  Animals caught the next morning are removed from traps by forcefully dumping them into plastic bags; this allows one to orient the animal and get a good grip on it for identification and measurement.  Each animal is then identified to species and weighed to the nearest gram using a pesola scale.  Body, tail, foot, and ear measurments are taken to the nearest millimeter using a plastic ruler. Reproductive status is determined by examining the genitalia.  Each animal is sexed, aged (juvenile/adult) and marked.  Marking is done with a Sharpie permanent marker on each animal on the first night's capture for that individual.  The animals are then placed back into their traps and released at the exact site of capture after which the traps are rebaited.Removal websRemoval traps are checked and rebaited as the mark-and-recapture traps. All closed traps are checked to insure they contained small mammals (other animals such as birds and reptiles are released); each trap is marked with the web and trap number and then removed from the web and replaced with an empty a trap.  The animals are then brought back to the laboratory to be processed.Below is the species list of all the small mammals caught on the 6 trapping sites.  Each species is given a four letter field code, usually consisting of the first 2 leters of the genus and the first 2 leters of the specific names. Measurements made in the field and laboratory for each species also are listed:1. BL: body length2. TL: tail length3. HF: hind foot length4. EL: ear lengthThe species and their measurements are as follows:anim:  Ammospermophilus interpres           measurements: noneamle:  Ammospermophilus leucurus            measurements: nonechin:  Chaetodipus intermedius              measurements: noneclga:  Clethrionomys gapperi                measurements: ?dior:  Dipodomys ordi                       measurements: nonedime:  Dipodomys merriami                   measurements: nonedisp:  Dipodomys spectabilis                measurements: noneeuqu:  Eutamias quadrivittatus              measurements: noneeudo:  Eutamias dorsalis                    measurements: noneeuci:  Eutamias cinereicollis               measurements: noneeusp:  Eutamias species                     measurements: nonemime:  Microtus mexicanus                   measurements: ?neal:  Neotoma albigula                     measurements: noneneme:  Neotoma mexicana                     measurements: nonenemi:  Neotoma micropus                     measurements: nonenest:  Neotoma stephensi                    measurements: nonenesp:  Neotoma species                      measurements: noneonar:  Onychomys arenicola                  measurements: BL, TLonle:  Onychomys leucogaster                measurements: BL, TLonsp:  Onychomys species                    measurements: BL, TLpgfv:  Perognathus flavus                   measurements: BL, TLpgfl:  Perognathus flavescens               measurements: BL, TLpgsp:  Perognathus species                  measurements: BL, TLpmbo:  Peromyscus boylii                    measurements: BL, TL, HF, ELpmdi:  Peromyscus difficilis                measurements: BL, TL, HF, ELpmer:  Peromyscus eremicus                  measurements: BL, TL, HF, ELpmle:  Peromyscus leucopus                  measurements: BL, TL, HF, ELpmma:  Peromyscus maniculatus               measurements: BL, TL, HF, ELpmtr:  Peromyscus truei                     measurements: BL, TL, HF, ELpmsp:  Peromyscus species                   measurements: BL, TL, HF, ELremg:  Reithrodontomys megalotis            measurements: BL, TLremo:  Reithrodontomys montanus             measurements: BL, TLresp:  Reithrodontomys species              measurements: BL, TLspsp:  Spermophilus spilosoma               measurements: nonespva:  Spermophilus variagatus              measurements: nonesyau:  Sylvilagus auduboni                  measurements: noneLaboratory Procedures: When animals are brought back to the field station, each is given an NK (New Mexico Karyotype) number and then killed by accepted and approved procedures. The animal is immediatedly removed from the jar and brushed for ectoparasites using a toothbrush.  Any ectoparasites found are placed into a small vial (Wheaton, 4 ml) with 70 0.000000E+00tOH and a label with its NK number. The host is then given to the mammalogists for identification, measurement, collection of tissues for electrophoresis, etc. (see mammal procedures).  Once the carcass is returned, an incision is made in the abdomen beginning just above the genital area and ending just below the thoracic cavity.  The entire gastrointestinal tract is removed by cutting the esophagusjust anterior to the stomach and the colon just anterior to the anus.  The GI tract is then placed into a Petri dish with a small amount of water (to keep it moist); it is then untangled and the mesentary is removed.  Fecal pellets are then removed from the colon and placed into a Wheaton vial (20 ml) containing 2138ebcotassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) and the host's NK number. The stomach is then removed by cutting the pyloric sphincter.  The stomach is then cut open by making a lateral incision along the length of the stomach after which the contents are emptied into a sieve (40mesh) and rinsed with tap water.  The remaining material is placed back into a clean Petri dish and surveyed for parasites using a dissecting scope.  The small intestine (duodenum, ileum, jejunum) is dissected in a clean Petri dish making a longitudinal incision along the length of the intestine.  The contents of the intestine are then examined (scraping the intestine with a #0 insect pin) for parasites using a dissecting scope.  The cecum is dissected by making an incision along the length of the cecum after which the contents are emptied into a sieve (60 mesh) and rinsed with tap water.  The remaining material is then placed into a clean Petri dish and examined using a dissecting scope. Nematodes are fixed in GAA (Glacial Acetic Acid) until they are relaxed (3-4 min) and then stored in 100uffered formalin.  Cestodes and Acanthocephalans are relaxed in dH2O (30-45 min) and then fixed and stored in 100uffered formalin.  Fecal pellets are examined by sugar floatation. If viscera were not necropsied in the field they were frozen for later examination.Below is the species list of all the parasites found in the small mammals caught on the 2 removal trapping webs from all 6 sites.  Each species is given a four letter code, usually consisting of the first 2 letters of the genus and the first 2 letters of the specific name.  The coccidia are different however, the first letter designates the genus with the last 3 letter comming from the specific name and is periodically being updated. A updated list can be found on the web site (http://sevilleta/data/species/parasite/) The species are as follows:acan:	acanthocephala spadsp:	Adelina speciescaut:	Catenotaenia utahensiscuau:	Cuterebra austenicune: 	Cuterebra neomexicanacusp: 	Cuterebra speciescest: 	cestode spealb: 	Eimeria albigulaeeari: 	Eimeria arizonensisebal: 	Eimeria balphaiecal: 	Eimeria callospermophiliecha: 	Eimeria chaetodipiechi: 	Eimeria chihuahuaensisecho: 	Eimeria chobotariedip: 	Eimeria dipodomysisedor: 	Eimeria dorsaliseere: 	Eimeria eremiciehis: 	Eimeria hispidensiselad: 	Eimeria ladronensiselan: 	Eimeria langebartelielat: 	Eimeria lateraliseleu: 	Eimeria leucopielio: 	Eimeria liomysisemer: 	Eimeria merriamiemoh: 	Eimeria mohavensiseneo: 	Eimeria neotomaeeony: 	Eimeria onychomysisepeg: 	Eimeria perognathieper: 	Eimeria peromyscieree: 	Eimeria reediesch: 	Eimeria scholtyseckiespp: 	Eimeria speciesetam: 	Eimeria tamiasciuruseuta: 	Eimeria utahensisflea:  	Siphonaptera sphede: 	Heteromyoxyuris desertihyci: 	Hymenolepis citelliissp: 	Isospora speciesiper: 	Isospora peromyscilice: 	Mallophaga or Anopluramadi: 	Mastophorus dipodomismadp: 	Mathovetaenia dipodomimite: 	Acarimocl: 	Moniliformis clarkina:   	not availablenega:	negative nanema: 	Nematode spoode: 	Oochoristica desertiposi: 	positive naphma: 	Physaloptera massinoptdi: 	Pterygodermatites dipodomisrare: 	Raillietina retactalisscdi: 	Schizorchodes dipodomisyeu: 	Syphacia eutamiitick: 	Acaritrdi: 	Trichuris dipodomistrel: 	Trichuris elatoristrem: 	trematode spunsp: 	unsporulated na</literalLayout>
