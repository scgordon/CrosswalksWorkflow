    <section>
      <para> Ammonia volatilization was measured at three sites in the
 Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico, U.S.A. In dry
 soils, ammonia volatilization ranged from 9 to 11 micrograms
 of nitrogen per square meter per day, but rates increased to
 95 micrograms of nitrogen per square meter per day in a
 shrubland site after an experimental addition of water.
 Ammonia volatilization also increased with experimental
 additions of NH4Cl and decreased with additions of sucrose.
 Competition by nitrifiers for available NH4+ had little
 effect on NH3 volatilization: N-Serve, added to inhibit
 nitrification, decreased NH3 volatilization in a grassland
 site and had little effect at other sites. We suggest that
 NH3 volatilization is controlled by the rate of
 mineralization of NH4+ from soil organic matter, and
 mineralization is stimulated by rainfall. Overall rates of
 NH3 volatilization from undisturbed desert ecosystems appear
 to be much lower than those reported for rangeland and
 agricultural soils.

 Data set shows ammonia volatilization from the grassland soils
 at the base of Mount Summerford in response to a variety of
 experimental treatments chosen to elucidate the processes
 controlling the volatilization rate. Ammonia is collected in
 weak acid in scintillation vials placed inside PVC chambers in
 the field. The rate of ammonia volatilization per unit area
 (ugN/m2/day) is found by multiplying the concentration in the
 acid by 1250.</para>

      <literalLayout> Field investigations were made on the New Mexico State
 University Ranch, 40 km NNE of Las Cruces, N.M. in the
 Jornada Del Muerto Basin. The experimental plots were
 established at three sites along the desert Long Term
 Ecosystem Research (LTER) transect that crosses the alluvial
 piedmont of Mount Summerford in the Dona Ana Mountains. One
 site was located in a grassland dominated by Bouteloua
 eriopoda in the upper reaches of the piedmont. A second
 site was in a mid-slope position in a shrubland dominated by
 Larrea tridentata, an invasive desert species. The third
 site was located in an ephemeral dry lake, or playa,
 dominated by Panicum obtusum, at the base of the piedmont.</literalLayout>

      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout> A set of experiments was established in the grassland
 in June 1989. Water, N-serve and CaC2-generated C2H2 were
 applied in a full 3-way factorial design in 8 tubes in each
 of 10 blocks, each of which included an unmanipulated
 control tube. Water and N-serve were applied as in 1988.
 C2H2 was applied by covering these tubes with a PVC cap and
 injecting 30 ml C2H2 into the headspace through a rubber
 septum. The volume was chosen to greatly exceed the 10 Pa
 level, which is found, in short-term exposures, to cause a
 persistent inhibition of nitrification in soils (Berg et
 al., 1982; Hyman and Wood, 1985). The syringe was pumped
 several times to ensure mixing of the C2H2 into the soil
 pore space. After 10 min the cap was removed, and all tubes
 were allowed to equilibrate in the field for 24 h. NH3 was
 collected during the subsequent 24 h using the 1988
 procedures. Following gas collections, the columns were
 removed, the soil was homogenized and sieved (</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha
