        <geographicDescription>Five Points Black Grama is on the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitat. The site is subject to intensive research activity, including assessments of net primary productivity, phenology, and pollinator diversity, amongst other projects.&#160; It is the site of the unburned black grama (GU) component of the Burn NPP study. On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the Five Points Black Grama site.&#160; Portions of this site were burned, but not the entirety.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the burn. &#160;</geographicDescription>

        <geographicDescription>The Rio Salado is an ephemeral tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR, flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland &amp; Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites. Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site because the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location Met Station 44.The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power lines.&#160; An earthen berm stops road travel here and the met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.&#160;</geographicDescription>

      <para>
        <literalLayout>The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following&#194;&#160;questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of&#194;&#160;shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? &#194;&#160; 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and &#194;&#160;long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? 4) Do small mammals interact with other herbivore and granivore consumers enough to affect the species composition and abundance&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s of other consumers such as ants and grasshoppers?</literalLayout>

          <literalLayout>07/10/03 &#194;&#160;- Checked data for missing data points, doubles, and errors. &#194;&#160;Missing data points were recorded using periods (.), duplicates of data points were removed, and errors were corrected. &#194;&#160;If a data point contained a measurement of zero and a measurement with an observation, the zero observation was removed. - Missing all plots for BLOCK 1 at the Grassland Site for the spring except BLOCK 1 PLOT 1 TRT L. &#194;&#160;Other plots that are missing from the Grassland Site in the spring are BLOCK 2 PLOT 3 TRT C, BLOCK 3 PLOT 3 TRT R, and BLOCK 4 PLOT 2 TRT C. All plots are present for the fall, but several data points are missing. - Removed Species, Comments, and Per fields. &#194;&#160;Tape field was changed to ID#. If there were no observations made in the previously named Tape field, observations from the Per field were moved to the new ID# field. &#194;&#160;EC field was added and NA was recorded in this field for this year and any comments made were put in this field. &#194;&#160;Date MM/DD/YY field was changed to just DATE. Other changes in the fields include PLT to PLOT, BLK to BLOCK, SPECIES to SD, COV to COVER, and HT to DEPTH. - All quads for this year originally had AD recorded as the soil disturbance seen. &#194;&#160;This is an unknown code. The comments field contained actual soil disturbance codes. &#194;&#160;AD was removed and replaced with the soil disturbance codes found in the comments field. - Negative values in the depth field were given their absolute &#194;&#160;value. - Several quads contained AB for soil disturbance. &#194;&#160;This is an unknown code. AB was changed to AH, arthropod hole, because 1996 data had AB also and stated it was an arthropod burrow. &#194;&#160;We currently use AH to identify all arthropod holes. Also, &#226;&#8364;&#732;originally AB&#226;&#8364;&#8482; was recorded in the EC field for these data points. A few quads had RT, an unknown code, recorded for soil disturbance. &#194;&#160;Changed RT to UD and &#226;&#8364;&#732;originally RT&#226;&#8364;&#8482; was recorded in the EC field. &#194;&#160;Any similar corrections were dealt with in the same manner. - Any data points that had a zero value in cover field were categorized &#194;&#160;SD, which is used when there is no soil disturbance present, and the depth field was given a zero value. - Any empty cells were filled in with either a period for missing data or an NA for not applicable. - Terri Koontz 07/14/03 &#194;&#160;- Modified metadata to correct format. - Terri Koontz 07/21/03 &#194;&#160;- Spring Field Season Changes For Grass Site BLOCK 2 PLOT 1 TRT L, there were two observations for most quads that had different dates (05/02/95, 05/03/95, and 05/04/95). &#194;&#160;All data points with either 05/02/95 or 05/03/95 were changed to BLOCK 1 PLOT 1 TRT L. &#194;&#160;This was done because one other plot for BLOCK 2 had some quads with this same date. &#194;&#160;Also, it seemed logical that BLOCK 1 would have been measured first. - Terri Koontz 7/23/03 &#194;&#160; - Changed data to fit parameters. &#194;&#160;For example if a measurement was 0.25 it was rounded to the closest 0.1 value, which in this case is 0.3. &#194;&#160;Also, if there was a measurement less than 0.05 these were rounded up to 0.1 to show that an occurence was present. &#194;&#160;See 'Variable Descriptions' Variable 8. - Terri Koontz 07/10/03 &#194;&#160;- Checked data for missing data points, doubles, and errors. Missing data points were recorded using periods (.), duplicates of data points were removed, and errors were corrected. &#194;&#160;If a data point contained a measurement of zero and a measurement with an observation, the zero observation was removed. - Removed Comments and Per fields. &#194;&#160;Tape field was changed to ID#.

              <literalLayout>Experimental Design: There are 2 study sites, the Five Points grassland site, and the Rio Salado creosotebush site. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 experimental study plots, each occupying 1/4 of each block. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the top to the north. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L). The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner (north-west) of each plot (top being north), and running left (west) to right (east), then down (south) one row, and then right (east) to left (west), and so on Quadrat/rebar number one is in the northwest corner of each plot, and numbers 1-6 are across the north side of the plot west to east, then quadrat/rebar number 7 is just south of quadrat/rebar number 6, and rebar numbers increase 7-12 east to west, and so on. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left (north-west) corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. While measuring vegetation on each quad, soil surface disturbances identified by what animal caused the disturbance was measured. The same method as measuring plant cover from the vegetation measurement frame was used. The soil surface disturbance as portions of the 10cm by 10cm grid squares was measured using the maximum depth/height of each disturbance type.</literalLayout>
