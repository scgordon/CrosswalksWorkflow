      <para>This coverage was obtained in digital form from Chris Barton of the USGS. Bedrock
                geology in the Hubbard Brook Valley was mapped by C.C. Barton, R.H. Comerlo, and
                S.W. Bailey, August 1994 to August 1995. The Map is entitled "BEDROCK GEOLOGIC MAP
                OF HUBBARD BROOK EXPERIMENTAL FOREST AND MAPS OF FRACTURES AND GEOLOGY IN ROADCUTS
                ALONG INTERSTATE 93, GRAFTON COUNTY, NEW HAMPSHIRE" and was approved for publication
                on August 28, 1995. The benchmark adjacent to the Hubbard Brook Headquarters
                building was set by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation in 1993. The
                station is a standard NHDOT disk stamped "Hubbard Brook 1993", set into the top of a
                4 FT long by 5 IN granite monument flush with the ground and level with the parking
                lot. Located 17.5 FT (5.3 M) southeast from the southeast corner post for a fence
                and the orange carsonite marker, 49.5 FT (15.1 M) northeast from the north corner of
                the office building, 60 FT (18.3 M) east from the west face of the concrete curb,
                51.0 FT (15.5 M) south from the northeast corner post for a fence. Benchmark
                location: NAD83 Latitude = 43 56 38.0361 Longitude = 71 42 03.9897 Northing =
                160408.164 Meters Easting = 297235.062 Meters NAD27 Latitude = 43 56 37.7891
                Longitude = 71 42 05.7012 Northing = 526,241.45 Feet (State Plane Zone 4676) Easting
                = 490,803.21 Feet Elevation = 833.87 Feet NGVD29 (El order 31). Data distributed as shapefile in

                        The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly
                        increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among
                        disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to
