          <literalLayout>As part of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, a systematic sampling program has been undertaken to monitor the glacial meltwater streams in that region. These tables contain data pertaining to continuous monitored water quality and quantity parameters measured with automatic recording devices on streams in this region. Specifically, this metadata record describes the Hydrology data for the Bohner Stream, whose hydrological measurements began in 2011 and are ongoing. Gage control was constructed on 27 Jan 2011 at -77.696302 62.558285 the data record began on 02 Feb 2011. Since this is a new site, we need multiple seasons of record to develop stage-discharge relationship. Preliminary data is available upon email request, but will be superseded by final data. Please contact the data manager with your detailed request for preliminary discharge data.</literalLayout>

            <para>
              <literalLayout>Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or Campbell temperature/conductivity probes. Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes. Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is loaded into Aquarius, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made. For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining good data inside of Aquarius. The data is pulled out of Aquarius, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database. For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations and datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered into Aquarius. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into Aquarius. All corrections and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. The data is pulled out of Aquarius, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into ORACLE and the McMurdo database.</literalLayout>
