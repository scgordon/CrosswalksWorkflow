        <geographicDescription>Lake Hoare occupies a narrower portion of the Taylor Valley, dammed by the Canada Glacier. It would drain almost completely without this dam. There are a number of islands which may be related to an old terminal of Canada Glacier. The lake is fed primarily from direct runoff from the glacier, as well as meltwater streams. (Lake level rose ~1.5 m between 1972 and 1996). There are no surface outflows; the only known water loss is through ice ablation (evaporation, sublimation and physical scouring).

        <geographicDescription>The Lake Fryxell basin is formed by a moraine depression in a wider portion of the Taylor Valley. It has a number of moraine islands and shallower areas, as well as several relatively well developed deltas. The lake is fed by at least 10 meltwater streams with a total drainage catchment of 230 km2. The lake is dammed to the southwest by the Canada Glacier and is topographically closed. It is perennially ice covered; during summer months, an ice-free moat generally forms around much of the lake margin. Lake levels have risen ~2 m between 1971 and 1996. There are no surface outflows; the only known water loss is through ice ablation (evaporation, sublimation and physical scouring).

            <para>
              <literalLayout>&#194;&#160;Data was collected by Jeffrey Schmok in November 1995 in order to prepare the Golder report on the bathymetry of Lakes Hoare, Fryxell, and Bonney. A 0.0 m contour is based on a shoreline survey of the frozen moat, and therefore is closer to piezometric water level than to top surface of floating permanent ice. Deeper contours are based on piezometric water level. Thus volume calculations within the ice cover represent volumes of liquid water as if the ice was melted.&#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; Third order polynomial equations were fit to the area vs. depth data both from Schmok's report and from the digitized map data, using SigmaPlot's curve fitting routine. However, since the contour data are already a "best-fit" of measured depth data, and contour intervals are relatively small, it was decided to linearly interpolate the depth:area &#194;&#160;relationships for depths between the measured depth contours, at 0.5m intervals. Volume was &#194;&#160;calculated for each 0.5m increment as a truncated cone &#194;&#160;(V=(h/3)*(A1+A2+sqrt(A1*A2)).</literalLayout>
