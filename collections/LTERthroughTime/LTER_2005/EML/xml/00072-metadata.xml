Herb communities were sampled using 250-400 m transects. These transects were placed in (a) highly disturbed, small patches of forest; (b) highly disturbed, large patches; and (c) relatively undisturbed, large patches. Herb diversity/abundance, terrain shape, and soil chemistry was sampled at a 10-m resolution. Species richness was greatest in the least disturbed sites in large patches. Disturbance negatively affected the coverage of old-growth indicator species, lilies, and mesophytic species. Differences in patch size, given the same level of disturbance, did not significantly affect the coverage of old-growth indicators and mesophytic species. Weedy species were most abundant in small patches. Disturbance had no significant effect on these weedy species in large patches. The abiotic factors having the greatest influence on coverage of cove and mesophytic species were: soil humic matter and soil pH. Terrain shape, soil cations, P and Ca were correlated with soil humic matter and pH.</para><para>Herbaceous communities were sampled at sites have three levels of disturbance: low (no evidence of past disturbance or logged &gt;1920), moderate (logged &gt;1 time since 1870), high (previous agricultural use, woodland grazing and/or logging). There were 3, 6, and 4 sites at the low, moderate, and high disturbance levels, respectively. Each site was sampled using transect 250-400 m long, sampled every 2 m using a 0.5 m2 quadrat. In each quadrat, the count and percent coverage was recorded for each species.  During analysis, five quadrats along a 10-m sections of the transects were summed. This 10-m data corresponds to the scale of soil and terrain shape

measurements. Every 10 m along the transect, a soil sample was taken and a measure of terrain shape was calculated. The soil was taken from the top 10cm of soil (A horizon).  These samples were analyzed for soil humic matter and chemical properties. Terrain shape was assessed by measuring the slope at eight points located 50 m from the transect at the cardinal and subcardinal directions. The sum of this slope provides an index of terrain shape (i.e., &gt;0=concave terrain, less than 0=convex).</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>land use</keyword><keyword>herbaceous species</keyword><keyword>land form</keyword><keyword>soil chemistry</keyword><keyword>soil carbon</keyword><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>transect sampling</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary4013_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>French Broad River Basin, Ivy Creek Watershed.

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
