Using mark-recapture techniques, we characterized the movements and space use behaviors of juvenile and adult mottled sculpin in a southern Appalachian stream. We then related these behaviors to spatial variation in benthic invertebrate colonization rates and small scale changes in local prey abundance. Observations made on the individual movements of sculpin indicated two distinct behavioral patterns: 1)despotic patch use, and 2)periodic patch abandonment. Our results on prey patch dynamics indicated that these behaviors were mediated by spatio-temporal variation in invertebrate distribution and dispersal. Adult sculpin maintained activities within patches of high prey abundance and exhibited persistent use of patches characterized by high invertebrate colonization rates. In addition, we found that patch abandonment by adult sculpin was induced by changes in the local abundance of invertebrate prey. In contrast to adults, patch use by juveniles appeared to be controlled primarilly by size-dependent competitive interactions. These results indicate that the dynamics of patch use by sculpin are controlled simultaneously by the dynamics of their patchily distributed prey and age/size dependent competitive interactions.</para><para>1.We sampled sculpin population seasonally (Spring, Early and Late Summer, Autumn) in each of four years (1994, 1995, 1996, 1997). Within each season we made a series of four sampling passes. During each pass we snorkeled the study site and capture individual sculpin with dip nets. Individuals were

weighed (nearest .01g) and measured (nearest 1mm) and given a unique mark using acrylic paints injected subcutaneously. We mapped the location of each individual using triangulation procedures. Individual movements were characterized as the distance between subsequent captures of the same individual over time. We measured microhabitat variables at each location (depth, current velocity, and substrate composition). We quantified invertebrate abundances within patches occupied by sculpin. We related movements by sculpin to changes in prey abundance and we quantified

invertebrate colonization rates in areas used persistently by sculpin.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>streams</keyword><keyword>habitat selection</keyword><keyword>sculpin</keyword><keyword>fishes</keyword><keyword>movement</keyword><keyword>macroinvertebrates</keyword><keyword>Patch dynamics</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary3011_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Shope Fork just below weir 8</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1994-07-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1997-11-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@sparc.ecology.uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
