This study was therefore conducted to ascertain (i) the level of similarity between the periphyton diatom communities from karstic wetland sites in Belize, Mexico, Jamaica and comparable sites within the FCE, (ii) the relationship between periphyton biomass, TP levels and diatom community composition at these sites, and (iii) the feasibility of employing diatoms as indicators of water quality at these sites, using models relating diatom community composition to water quality from comparable sites within the FCE.  Multiple wetland sites in Jamaica, the Yucatan region of Mexico and parts of Belize were visited between 2006 and 2008, during wet and dry seasons. At each site physico-chemical data were collected along with periphyton samples. The periphyton samples were processed in accordance with standard methods to obtain biomass, organic content and TP measures, and to identify and enumerate diatom and soft algae species. Various aspects of the diatom communities were then compared to previously compiled data on diatom communities from various parts of the FCE. SIMI analysis was used to determine the level of similarity between the systems and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling was used to identify relationships between diatom communities and water quality.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Periphyton</keyword><keyword>Biomass</keyword><keyword>Total phosphorus</keyword><keyword>Water quality</keyword><keyword>Organic content</keyword><keyword>Belize</keyword><keyword>Jamaica</keyword><keyword>Yucatan</keyword><keyword>Everglades National Park</keyword><keyword>Karstic wetlands</keyword><keyword>Diatoms</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>These data are classified as 'Type 4'  whereby these Data are related to the FCE LTER Program but not funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) LTER Grant #9910514 are available for scientific purposes no more than 4 years after collection.

At each Eleocharis wetland site, seven 1m2 areas were sampled using 1m2 throw traps.  At each plot, a photograph was taken to record the surface view of the quadrat and the cover of periphyton on dominant substrates estimated.  Periphyton was then cleared from plot, placed onto a seine net and sorted to remove animals, plants and marl.  Periphyton only samples were then measured using perforated 2000 ml graduated cylinder which excluded water, and the periphyton biovolume was recorded.  Submersed plants were then measured in the graduated cylinder to produce a total biovolume (Periphyton plus submersed plant) biovolume.  A subsample of 120 ml (volume of urine cup) of periphyton only material was removed and placed in a sterile sample bag and placed in a cooler with ice for transport to the lab.  When no observable periphyton mat was present, flocculent detritus was sampled non-quantitatively from the benthos and/or epiphytic fils were scraped from any macrophytes present.  In the laboratory, each periphyton sample (in its sample bag) was weighed and a wet weight plus bag value recorded.  The sample was then transferred to clean beaker, homogenized in a few ml distilled water (enough to fully moisten).  The total volume of the homogenized sample was then measured in a graduated cylinder and this volume recorded as the Total Volume.  The dried sample bag was then weighed and a bag weight recorded.  From the homogenized Total volume, a 50 ml subsample was poured into a pre-weighed aluminum pan, dried in an oven for 24 hours and later removed and weighed to produce a Periphyton dry mass (DW).  This sample was then placed in a muffle furnace for 3 hours and again weighed to produce an ash weight (AW).  A 50 ml subsample was removed, placed in a labeled 120 ml cup and placed in an oven until dry.  The dried contents were then ground and analyzed for nutrients (total phosphorus, total nitrogen, total carbon).  A 1 ml subsample was removed and placed in a microvial for soft algae analysis.  A 10 ml subsample was removed, put in vial and frozen until oxidized and analyzed for diatom analysis.  A 1 ml subsample was removed and filtered through a GFF filter which was then analyzed for chlorophyll a.</para></description><citation scope="document"><title>Fluorometric analysis of chlorophyll a in the presence of chlorophyll b and pheopigments</title><creator scope="document"><individualName><givenName>N</givenName><givenName>A</givenName><surName>Welschmeyer</surName></individualName></creator><pubDate>34501</pubDate><article><journal>Limnology and Oceanography</journal><volume>39</volume><issue>8</issue><pageRange>1985-1992</pageRange></article></citation><instrumentation>Portable pH/Conductivity/Temperature meter</instrumentation><instrumentation>Waterproof digital camera</instrumentation><instrumentation>Portable GPS</instrumentation><instrumentation>Biohomogenizer</instrumentation><instrumentation>Hand held blender</instrumentation><instrumentation>Fume hood Hot plate</instrumentation><instrumentation>oven</instrumentation><instrumentation>muffle furnace</instrumentation><instrumentation>Gilman fluorometer</instrumentation><instrumentation>Spectrophotometer</instrumentation><instrumentation>Carbon and Nitrogen analyzer (TC/TN, Perkin Elmer 2400 CHNSO)</instrumentation></methodStep><methodStep><description><para>Eleocharis wetland areas were located within the region of interest and before sampling was conducted, water chemistry measurements, including pH, conductivity, salinity and temperature, were taken.

climate, freshwater inputs, disturbance, and perturbations affect the coastal Everglades ecosystem. Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514</para></funding><studyAreaDescription><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these "upside-down" estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is:  In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.  Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

This study was therefore conducted to ascertain (i) the level of similarity between the periphyton diatom communities from karstic wetland sites in Belize, Mexico, Jamaica and comparable sites within the FCE, (ii) the relationship between periphyton biomass, TP levels and diatom community composition at these sites, and (iii) the feasibility of employing diatoms as indicators of water quality at these sites, using models relating diatom community composition to water quality from comparable sites within the FCE. Multiple wetland sites in Jamaica, the Yucatan region of Mexico and parts of Belize were visited between 2006 and 2008, during wet and dry seasons. At each site physico-chemical data were collected along with periphyton samples. The periphyton samples were processed in accordance with standard methods to obtain biomass, organic content and TP measures, and to identify and enumerate diatom and soft algae species. Various aspects of the diatom communities were then compared to previously compiled data on diatom communities from various parts of the FCE.
