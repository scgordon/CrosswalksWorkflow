Relative frequency of soil arthropod groups at Cub Hill

Introduction


The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has established a network of long-term permanent forest plots. These plots will provide long-term data on vegetation, soil and hydrologic processes in the key ecosystem types within the urban ecosystem. The current network of study plots includes eight forest plots, chosen to represent the range of forest conditions in the area. The goal of the soil invertebrate survey was to compare community composition and abundance of soil macrofauna, primarily earthworms (Oligochatea), terrestrial isopods (Isopoda: Oniscidea), and millipedes (Diplopoda).  

Plot Locations and Characterizations

In November of 1998 four rural, forested plots were established at Oregon Ridge Park in Baltimore County northeast of the Gwynns Falls Watershed. Oregon Ridge Park contains Pond Branch, the forested reference watershed for BES. Two of these four plots are located on the top of a slope; the other two are located midway up the slope.

Four urban, forested plots were established in November 1998, two at Leakin Park and two adjacent to Hillsdale Park in west Baltimore City in the Gwynns Falls. One of the plots in Hillsdale Park was abandoned in 2004 due to continued vandalism.

Plot locations:

Hillsdale 1: 39&#65533;19'28.14"N, 76&#65533;42'16.49"W
Hillsdale 2: 39&#65533;19'31.24"N, 76&#65533;42'28.62"W

Leakin 1: 39&#65533;18'1.32"N, 76&#65533;41'37.08"W
Leakin 2: 39&#65533;18'5.42"N, 76&#65533;41'34.15"W

Oregon top-slope - 1: 39&#65533;28'51.11"N, 76&#65533;41'22.50"W
Oregon mid-slope - 1: 39&#65533;28'51.32"N, 76&#65533;41'18.24"W
Oregon top-slope - 2: 39&#65533;29'12.74"N, 76&#65533;41'22.88"W
Oregon mid-slope - 2: 39&#65533;29'12.68"N, 76&#65533;41'18.62"W

Soil arthropods were sampled between November 1999 and 2000 using pitfall traps. At each plot a total of ten traps were placed which were emptied monthly. Earthworms were sampled using a combination of formalin solution (Raw 1954) and mustard suspension. 50cm x 50cm quadrats were used. Earthworms samples were taken is spring, summer and fall 1999, 2000, and 2002. In addition several qualitative samples were taken from residential and commercial areas in the city. 

Data were collected during in July 2002. Soil animals were searched for half an hour at each land cover types. A total of 14 residences were selected for this survey- and adata wer always collected between 11 am and 2 pm. Data were collected by undergraduates Janelle Harris and Jennifer Stiltz, as part of an NSF supported UMBEB project (BCEB: Baltimore Collaborative for Environmental Biology).

<geographicDescription>The Baltimore Ecosystem Study ultimately will conduct research and educational activities throughout the Baltimore metropolitan area. This large area includes Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and the counties of Ann Arundel, Carrol, Harford, Howard, and Montgomery. Gwynns Falls includes agricultural lands, recently suburbanized areas, established suburbs, and dense urban areas having residential, commercial and open spaces. In addition, a reference area has been established in a forested catchment of the Gunpowder drainage in Oregon Ridge County Park. </geographicDescription>
