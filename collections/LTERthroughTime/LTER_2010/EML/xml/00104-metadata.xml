Datum of Station - To be determined soon!
Equipment - J&amp; S Tipping Bucket rain gauge with HOBO Data recorder 
History

    * 31 October 2001 Gauge is installed in public gardens just inside of electric fence
    * Window screening is installed around gauge to prevent organisms from occupying it. The screening is taped around outside of gauge and stapled to platform it sets on. Refer to pictures for further illustration. This has been done sometime after installation. 

Panorama - This gauge is in a relatively open field bounded by forest
Calibration Measurements -Calibration Measurements - Calibration of this gauge should be preformed as described in the users manual. Each bucket should hold 8.24 mL of water before tipping. This should occur five consecutive times. Adjust calibration screws as needed.
Extreme Events No extreme events have been observed at this station to date.
Winter Records - Rain gauge is not heated and is subject to freezing.
Accuracy - Data should be ran through a quality control algorithm before use.
Cooperation - Baltimore Ecosystem Study and University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Cromwell Valley Park, Baltimore County
Photographs - Print collections may be available. Contact the MD-DE-DC District Office about any collections in the official station records.    See Baltimore Ecosystem Study Meteorology Overview here: http://beslter.org/frame7-page_1p.html .

<geographicDescription>The Baltimore Ecosystem Study ultimately will conduct research and educational activities throughout the Baltimore metropolitan area. This large area includes Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and the counties of Ann Arundel, Carrol, Harford, Howard, and Montgomery. Gwynns Falls includes agricultural lands, recently suburbanized areas, established suburbs, and dense urban areas having residential, commercial and open spaces. In addition, a reference area has been established in a forested catchment of the Gunpowder drainage in Oregon Ridge County Park. </geographicDescription>
