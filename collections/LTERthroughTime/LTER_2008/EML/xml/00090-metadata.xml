						<para>Chlorophyll is measured by collecting separate integrated samples from the
							epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion </para>
					</section>
					<section>
						<para>A. Chlorophyll Extraction 1. Dim the lights and keep the sample tubes in the
							freezer: Because chlorophyll degrades when exposed to light and heat, this procedure
							and all others associated with analyzing chlorophyll should be carried out in dim
							light conditions. Only one sample tube should be out of the freezer at any one time
							while the pre-grinding or grinding procedure is occurring. Return each tube to the
							freezer as soon as its filter has been ground. 2. Pre-grind filters: Use the sharpened
							stainless steel spatula to chop up the filter into small pieces. This should take
							approximately 1 minute. 3. Grind filters: Grind filters using the tissue homogenizer.
							Place the homogenizer into the tube with the chopped filter. Turn on the homogenizer
							once it is in the tube and grind for at approximately one minute, moving tube up and
							down to ensure all chopped filter pieces are ground up. Be sure to turn off
							homogenizer before removing it from the tube. Rinse homogenizer with acetone after
							every sample. 4. Return the sample tubes to the freezer for 24 hours: Most protocols
							call for storing the grinded samples at 4 degree C. However, after storing duplicate
							samples in the freezer and refrigerator (after grinding) there was no significant
							difference in the chlorophyll results. Because past samples have been stored in the
							freezer, this is the current procedure being used. B. Centrifuging the Samples: The
							samples should be centrifuged as close as possible to 24 hours after extraction.
							Before centrifuging the samples, turn on the spectrophotometer vis light to allow the
							light to warm up for 60 minutes. 1. Loading the Marathon 21000 Fisher Scientific
							centrifuge: Making sure that the caps are on tight, put tubes with equal acetone
							volumes opposite each other in the centrifuge. If there is an odd tube remaining or a
							tube with a different volume, put a spare tube opposite the sample with the same
							volume of water to counterbalance the centrifuge. It is essential to load centrifuge
							buckets evenly to ensure proper balance. 2. Running the centrifuge: Run the centrifuge
							at 4000 RPMs for 15 minutes. This is programmed as Program 1 on the centrifuge. If the
							centrifuge is on Program 1, just press start and it will go automatically. If there is
							an imbalance in the centrifuge the centrifuge will shut down. In this case, stop the
							centrifuge and attempt to locate the imbalance. Sometimes this requires a placement
							shift in the center post of the bucket holders. 3. Unloading the centrifuge: Carefully
							take each sample tube out of the centrifuge with minimal mixing. If the filter paper
							is mixed with the liquid, it will be necessary to re-centrifuge the sample. Transport
							the samples to the freezer until it is time to process. C. Running a Sample: Ensure
							the spectrophotometer vis light has been on for at least 60 minutes. Exit from the
							small screen with the start-up results. Make sure the cuvette holder in the
							spectrophotometer is empty and clear of anything that could block the light waves. 1.
							Select the test: Click on Fix Wavelength, then click on Method on the top of the
							screen, choose LTERCHLA (the screen will not change). Exit from this small screen. 2.
							Run a blank and check that all cuvettes read near 0: Add acetone to a 1x1 mm, chemical
							resistant, macro, disposable cuvette and wipe it clean with a tissue then place it in
							the holder inside the spectrophotometer. Left click on Blank. No numbers will appear,
							this is just a calibration. Click on Read Sample on the top left of the screen. All of
							the readings at all wavelengths should be within .001 of 0 or under 0.0004. If this is
							not the case, remove the suspect cuvette and rinse, wipe, add acetone, and rerun it.
							Make sure that the correct program is being run by checking the wavelengths. The LTER
							samples should be run at 750, 665, 664, 647, and 630 nm. 3. Add sample to a cuvette:
							Before bringing the samples into the spectrophotometer room, turn off the overhead
							light. Carefully remove a sample from the rack and pipette approximately 2 mL of
							sample into a cuvette. Use caution not to suck up any filter paper into the pipette;
							tilt the sample to the side and submerge the pipette tip only just below the fluid
							level. If the pipette tip is getting close to the filter paper when removing the
							second mL of sample, stop pipetting and add the partial mL to the cuvette (it is
							possible to read approximately 1.5 mL of sample). 4. Check the 750 nm reading and run
							the sample: Insert the cuvette into the spec. making sure that the clear sides of the
							cuvette are facing left and right. The default reading on the spec is 750 nm. Click on
							Run Sample. Check to make sure that this reading is less than 0.010. If the reading is
							higher, remove the cuvette and re-wipe it with a tissue. If the reading is still high,
							pour the sample back into the tube and re-centrifuge it. 5. Rinse the pipette tip:
							Before adding another sample to a cuvette, the pipette tip should be rinsed with
							acetone. You should have 2 different sized beakers, one for waste and one for acetone
							rinse. Be sure that the pipette tip is firmly on the pipette (press it on the bottom
							of the rinse beaker). 6. Acidify the sample: Once the sample has been run, remove it
							from the spec and add 60 uL of 0.1 N HCl (30 uL per 1 mL of sample). Gently shake the
							sample and wait 90 seconds to run it. C. Running Multiple Samples: 1. It may be more
							efficient to run 2 samples before acidification and then run them both after
							acidification. If this is done, take caution to add the correct sample to the correct
							cuvette and not to mix up the samples when they are removed from the spec. for
							acidification. Recording the Results: 1. Record the results of each sample for every
							wavelength designated on spreadsheet before and after acidification. Be sure to
							include the lake, mL filtered, date of sample and date of analysis. Clean-up: 1. Rinse
							thoroughly and discard all used cuvettes and tubes of processed samples. 2. Dilute all
							samples to a solution of less than 20percent Acetone and disposed of down the drain.
							Fill the waste beaker with water and pour the waste down the sink with the water
							running. Leave the water running for several minutes 3. Rinse the beakers and pipette
							tips 3 times with tap water followed by 3 rinses with distilled water. &#194;&#160; </para>

			<abstract>
				<para>The importance of the position of a lake in the landscape relative to hydrologic flow
					has been a focus of the Long-Term Ecological Research Project, based at the UW-Madison
					Center for Limnology, for almost two decades. We have found that there are strong patterns
					in water chemistry, primary productivity, and morphology driven by ground and surface
					water inputs (Magnuson et. al. 1990, Kratz et al. 1997, Riera et al. in press). Also, lake
					size and physico-chemical conditions within a lake have been shown to influence community
					structure in fishes (Tonn and Magnuson 1982, Tonn et al.1990). However, we know much less
					about how landscape level traits, such as surface water connections, influence biotic
					diversity and community structure within lakes and whether the species pool changes across
					watersheds of North-Central Wisconsin (Hrabik and Magnuson 1999). The primary goal of our
					project is to conduct field experiments that contrast lake chemical and geographical
					properties and explore the role of those properties in shaping biotic diversity and
					community structure. </para>

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Lake is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a seepage lake with predominantly sand substrate. It has a surface area of 36.7 hectare, 2.3 kilometers of highly developed shoreline and a maximum depth of 20.4 meters.
Crystal Lake represents one extreme in the groundwater input gradient, with a marked predominance of precipitation inputs. Groundwater accounts for only 5% of input water, yet, because groundwater is more concentrated chemically than precipitation, groundwater accounts for substantial amounts of incoming solutes. For example, about 50% of the silica budget comes into the lake via groundwater, exerting a major influence on primary production.
The lake is an oligotrophic, dimictic lake high in the landscape with minimal groundwater input, a light attenuation coefficient of 0.24 per meter (average ice-free Secchi depth of 8 m), a mean depth of 11.4 m, and a maximum depth of 20.4 m. Crystal Lake is circular with a shoreline development factor very close to 1.0. The littoral zone is fairly homogenous and is dominated by sandy substrate with low macrophyte and coarse woody habitat densities. The fish community has been historically dominated by pelagic yellow perch. However, yellow perch drastically declined after the detection of rainbow smelt in 1985.
