      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points Black Grama is on the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitat. The site is subject to intensive research activity, including assessments of net primary productivity, phenology, and pollinator diversity, amongst other projects.&#160; It is the site of the unburned black grama (GU) component of the Burn NPP study.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the Five Points Black Grama site.&#160; Portions of this site were burned, but not the entirety.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the burn.
&#160;Vegetation: The Five Points Black Grama site is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda)., </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral  tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR,  flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and  Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and  ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites.  Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although  rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site  because the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are  co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location Met Station 44.The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power 	lines.&#160;  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the 	met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.&#160;Vegetation: The Rio Salado Larrea site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), with honey mesquite, fourwing saltbush, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra), and broom snakeweed as co-occurring shrubs. Dominant grasses are black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), and fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum). Common forb species include desert holly (Acourtia nana), spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa spp.), blackfoot daisey (Melampodium leucanthum), twinleaf (Senna bauhinoides), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala). While individual creosote bushes tend to be larger, overall plant cover is less than at the creosote core site at Five Points, with more exposed embedded stones and gravel on the soil surface, creating a pavement-like appearance., </geographicDescription>

          <para>
            <literalLayout>Experimental Design:There are 2 study sites, the Five Points grassland site, and the Rio  Salado creosotebush site. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at  each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals.  Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 experimental study plots, each occupying 1/4 of each block. The blocks of study plots  are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the top to the north.  Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C), one  plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L). The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters.Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner (north-west) of each plot (top being   north), and running left (west) to right (east), then down (south) one row, and then right (east) to left (west), and so on Quadrat/rebar number one is in the northwest corner of each plot, and numbers 1-6 are across the north side of the plot west to east, then quadrat/rebar number 7 is just south of quadrat/rebar number 6, and rebar numbers increase 7-12 east to west, and so on. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left(north-west) corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot.While measuring vegetation on each quad, the total amount of leaf litter cover on the soil surface that  was seen on each quadrat was measured. "Leaf litter cover(n)" for the cover of leaf litter on the soil surface of the quadrat was stated in terms of the 10 cm squares. For cover values less than 5, increments of 1.0 were used. For cover values greater than 5, increments of 5.0 were used. Leaf litter included all detached dead plant material on the soil surface, including woody branches. Only leaf litter cover that is in the open was measured, not within clumps of grass, etc. Some leaf litter cover had distinctive margins and was easy to define and measure. However, much leaf litter consisted of many diffuse small patches that are separated by bare soil, and distributed throughout the quadrat. For such diffuse cover,  the actual cover in one typical 10 by 10 cm square (e.g., 0.3) was determined, the number of squares with diffuse cover (e.g., 5) was counted, then the number of squares was multiplied by the actual cover for a typical square (e.g., 0.3 X 5 = 1.5, then round to 1.0 or 2.0, or if the value had been greater than 5, round to the nearest increment of 5.0) for the total litter cover. All litter cover was pooled into one observation, and no height was measured.</literalLayout>
