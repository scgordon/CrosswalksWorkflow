        <abstract>
          <para>
          Imperviousness for the Baltimore MSA from the NLCD 2001 impervious dataset.  Impervious surfaces refers to impenetrable surfaces such as rooftops, roads or parking lots. Quantification of imperviousness can offer a relatively objective measure of urban density and provide a forum for its classification. For NLCD 2001, imperviousness was chosen as the surrogate for the urban intensity classification in an effort to improve the precision of urban characterization used in the original NLCD 1992. Modeling empirical relationships between imperviousness and Landsat data is accomplished using regression tree techniques. Several one-meter digital orthophoto quadrangles are used for each Landsat scene to derive reference impervious data needed for calibrating the relationships between percent imperviousness and Landsat spectral data, which are then modeled using a commercial regression tree algorithm called Cubist. The models are then applied to all pixels in a mapping zone to produce a per-pixel estimate of imperviousness in urban areas (Yang et al., 2002). This procedure quantifies the spatial distribution of impervious surfaces as a continuous variable for urban areas from 1 to 100%, and offers a consistent and repeatable method to characterize urban areas across the Nation. This data layer is then masked to ensure only urban pixels are included and thresholded (Table 1) into NLCD 2001 urban classes and inserted into the land cover. Imperviousness information will be available as an independent product of NLCD 2001.  The National Land Cover Database 2001 for mapping zone 60 was produced  through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land  Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of  federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey  (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS),  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management  (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of  the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent,  seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for  the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition  and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al.  (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp.  The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A  total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S.  based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edgematching features  and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses  whole or portions of several states in the mid-Atlantic region, including  the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and  the District of Columbia. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 60 can be  directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS EROS Data  Center (EDC), Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.</para><para>
