The basis for the study is an ongoing, experimental prescribed burning program begun in 1964 at Cedar Creek, and a similar program operating since 1962 on the adjacent Helen Allison Savanna property (owned by The Nature Conservancy). These prescribed burning programs are designed to subject upland oak communities (and some old fields) to different burn frequencies and patterns of burning, with the ultimate objectives of 1) restoring and maintaining the historically important savanna and open woodland vegetation, and 2) providing information about the effects of different burning patterns on vegetation structure and composition. This study addresses the latter of these two purposes and expands on it by also investigating possible influences of fire on resource availability (nutrients, water, and light) and net primary productivity.

The first burn was conducted in 1964, and all units not designated for fire protection had been burnt at least once by 1969. Two additional burn units west of East Bethel Blvd. received prescribed burns beginning in 1987 and 1992. Additional burn units have been added to the program in 1996, including 3 units along the west side of East Bethel Blvd., and one unit (409) that is a portion of one of the original "no burn" units. The Nature Conservancy began a similar prescribed burning experiment in 1962 on their 20 hectare Helen Allison Savanna property, which is adjacent to the Cedar Creek burn units. Eight rectangular 1-ha burn units were outlined on the east end of the property in a 4x2 design. The remaining 12 hectares were managed with protection from fire until 1987, when this unit was added to the burning program for conservation purposes. Prescribed fires are generally conducted in the spring using a form of the strip-headfire method. Firebreaks are disked in the spring prior to burning to remove most fuels. In areas where permanent fire breaks do not exist, the grass layer is mowed to produce a 1-2 meter wide fuel break. A backfire is started along the lee side of the burn unit, to widen the firebreak. Flanking fires are then lit along the sides of the units and monitored until a sufficiently wide blackline is produced. Finally, a headfire is started along the windward edge of the unit to complete the burn.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Sampling: Permanent Plots</para></listitem><listitem><para>A series of permanent plots have been established in the burn units to facilitate repeated sampling of tree, shrub, and herbaceous community composition. Plots are sampled every 5-6 years to monitor changes in structure and composition. The first twelve of these were established in CCNHA Fish Lake burn units in 1984 as part of experiment 015. Additional plots were added in 1990 as part of experiment 094, including four additional plots in the Fish Lake burn units, five in the "Davis grid" savanna area west of East Bethel boulevard, and three in the Allison Savanna burn units. Finally, three new plots were added in 1995, two in old fields and one in burn unit 104. Each plot consists of four parallel 50-meter transects placed 25 meters apart, outlining an area 50m x 75m. Points for quadrat sampling of herb and shrub cover are placed at 10 meter intervals along each transect for a total of 24 sample points per plot. (Note: the two old field plots, 22 and 28, were laid out as two 110-meter transects placed 25 meters apart, again producing 24 sample points.) Endpoints of each transect are marked with fenceposts (T-posts). The fencepost on the front end of each transect (points 1, 7, 13 and 19) are labeled with aluminum tags identifying the experiment (E133), plot number, and transect number. Interior sample points on each transect were marked by rebar posts starting in 1995 to facilitate true repeated sampling at each point.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Sampling: Trees</para></listitem><listitem><para>All trees within the 50m x 75m area were tagged in 1995 using numbered round aluminum tags. Tags were nailed to the tree at a height of 1.3-1.7 meters and facing the front of the plot (the long side with labeled fenceposts). Trees on many of the plots were previously tagged as part of experiment 094. These foil tags appear to have been highly susceptible to fire and animal damage, however, and were missing from a large proportion of the trees. Old and new tag numbers were matched up for the vast majority of trees, however, so individual trees can still be followed over time. The aluminum nails from the old tags are valuable, however, because the E094 diameter measurements were made 1 centimeter above this nail. The 1995 measurements were made at "breast height" (about 1.35 meters) as determined by the field crews, so there may be some inconsistencies between 1990 and 1995 measurements. Trees were surveyed in 1995 for species identification, status (alive, dead, snag, fallen), and diameter at breast height (dbh). Previous surveys also recorded approximate tree height and crown vigor (ordinal scale, 1-5) on some plots. On many of the plots, trees were also mapped to the nearest 0.1 meter using the "Topcon Total Station" surveying equipment. Since readings were taken to the edge of the tree, the true accuracy is probably somewhere between 0.1 and 0.4 meters. The mapping process included all tagged trees (&gt;= 5 cm) and the understory vegetation sample points.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Sampling: Oak seedling survival and demographics</para></listitem><listitem><para>This portion of the study is designed to improve our understanding of the influence of fire frequency and canopy cover on the spatial patterns, growth, and mortality/survival rates of oak seedlings. Belt transects have been established in five burn units representing the complete range of burn frequencies: unit 110 (no burns), 113 (4 burns/32 years), 107 (11/32), 105 (15/32), and 104 (26/32). In burn unit 104, there are four 100-m long transects placed within the macroplot (see E134). In the remaining units, there are three transects of 40 meters each within the permanent plots used for this study. Oak stems, both new germinants and older seedlings/sprouts have been tagged for long-term demographic studies. All oak stems less than 5 cm dbh that lie within 0.5 meter on either side of the transect are tagged with numbered aluminum tags. If an individual has multiple stems, only one stem is tagged. Tag number, location, species, height, and diameter are recorded for each individual at the time it is tagged. The position of each individual relative to the tree canopy is also noted as one of the following: under canopy, canopy edge, or open. Individuals are surveyed annually to assess both mortality and deer browse.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Sampling: Nitrogen cycling</para></listitem><listitem><para>Annual and seasonal nitrogen mineralization rates were estimated on 20 of the permanent plots in 1995. Six of these plots have been designated for long-term monitoring of N mineralization. N mineralization was measured over 5 incubation periods (approx. 30-45 days each) throughout the active growing season (mid-April to mid-October) in 1995. Eight replicates were used in each plot, corresponding to the same eight sample points used in the root core and litter trap samples (points 8-11, 14-17). We used a modified buried bag method to measure N mineralization as developed by Dave Wedin. At each point, a 0.75 inch diameter by 15 cm long soil core was removed from the sample area. This was our "initial" sample. A paired core was placed within 10 cm of the "initial" sample by pounding a sharpened piece of 0.75" diameter PVC pipe into the ground to a depth of 15 cm. The top of the pipe was plugged with a rubber cork to prevent water flow through the pipe. Air holes drilled between the soil surface and the cork facilitated ventilation of the sample during incubation. At the end of the incubation period, the PVC cores were extracted and returned to the laboratory for processing. Samples (both initial and final) were processed using standard Cedar Creek methods and will be described only briefly here. Samples are first homogenized. Soil nitrogen is extracted in 50 ml of 1 molar KCL solution and processed through the Cedar Creek autoanalyzer . Soil moisture content is determined gravimetrically. Additional soil cores were removed in fall of 1995 for purposes of measuring total soil carbon and nitrogen. At each of the 160 sample points used for the N mineralization measurements, four soil cores (0.75" diam. by 30 cm length) were removed from roughly evenly-spaced points along a 0.75 meter strip adjacent to the herbaceous vegetation sampling area. Each of these cores were divided into three depth segments (0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm) and pooled by depth. Two cores were extended to a depth of 50 cm and these two subsamples were pooled to produce a fourth depth sample (30-50 cm). Samples were dried and sifted to remove root material. A subsample was homogenized using a coffee mill and stored in a plastic sample bag for carbon and nitrogen analysis. The remainder of the sample was placed in a larger sample bag and archived for future use.
