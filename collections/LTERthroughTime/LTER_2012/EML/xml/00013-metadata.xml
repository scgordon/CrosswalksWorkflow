  <para>LiDAR data was analyzed to extract shoreline and dune features to extract points every 10 meters along the shoreline.</para>
  <para>ATM 1998, 2005 CHARTS and 2009 ERAL LiDAR data were used. 1997 data used a first-return LiDAR and was only used for shoreline delineation.</para>
  <para>Features were defined using definitions from Sallenger, A. H. 2000. Storm impact scale for barrier islands. Journal of Coastal Research 16:890&#226;&#8364;&#8220;895.&#194;&#160;</para>
  <para>Dhigh&#194;&#160; are point features of the position and elevation of the most seaward dune crest (known as Dhigh) derived from the lidar data. If there was no dune crest above 1.5m elev the berm was selected as Dhigh. All Dhigh points were selected from lidar data that was gridded and smoothed into cross-shore profiles every 10m alongshore. The grids are broken up into segments alongshore of similar shoreline orientation. To view the segments open the VA_segments shapefile. With in each segment the cross-shore profiles every 10 m were named profile 1, profile 2, profile 3, etc. That profile value is reflected in the attribute table in the column labeled 'profile'. The lat and lon of each Dhigh point is represented as well as northing and easting. The elevation of the dune crest is in the 'dhigh_z' column. The position of the dune is presented in a few columns. The cross-shore position of the dune is called 'dhigh_x' which refers to meters inland from the position 0. The 0 position is located between the two segment points.</para>
  <para>Dlow&#194;&#160; are point features of the position and elevation of the most seaward dune toe (known as Dlow) derived from the lidar data. If there was no dune crest above 1.5m elev the berm was selected as Dhigh and no Dlow exists. All Dlow points were selected from lidar data that was gridded and smoothed into cross-shore profiles every 10m alongshore. The grids are broken up into segments alongshore of similar shoreline orientation. To view the segments open the VA_segments shapefile. With in each segment the cross-shore profiles every 10 m were named profile 1, profile 2, profile 3, etc. That profile value is reflected in the attribute table in the column labeled 'profile'. The lat and lon of each Dlow point is represented as well as northing and easting. The elevation of the dune tow is in the 'dlow_z' column. The position of the dune is presented in a few columns. The cross-shore position of the dune toe is called 'dlow_x' which refers to meters inland from the position 0. The 0 position is located between the two segment points (VA_segments).&#194;&#160;</para>
  <para>Polygons of overwash probability during a hypothetical storm with characteristics similar to Hurricane Bonnie in 1998. The bar to the west is the probability of overwash for the VCR based on 1998 lidar data. The middle bar is the 2005 overwash probability based on the 2005 lidar data. And the most east bar is the 2009 overwash probability to the hypothetical storm. The storm surge used was 1.1m, the significant water wave height was 3.7m and the period was 7s. The probability is in part determined by comparing the relative elevation of the most seaward dune crest (Dhigh) and the maximum wave runup (Rhigh). Dhigh elevations are given in the attribute table. Each elevation value is a mean value representing 100m alongshore. The elevation of the most seaward dune toe (Dlow) also represents mean dlow elevation along the same 100m. R2 is the 2% exceedence elevation the swash will reach during the hypothetical storm. That elevation is added to the surge (1.1m) to equal Rhigh. Then the probability is represented as a % of overwash probability for each 100m segment of beach.</para>

Zip files contain ESRI shapefiles. The name of the file identifies the parameter contained in the file and the year. Dhigh files have the most seaward dune crest. Dlow files have the most seaward dune toe. Shoreline position is mean-high water (0.34 m &gt; mean-sea level).Additionally, the KML.zip file contains graphical representation of overwash probabilities for specific island-year combinations for display in Google Earth.

      <entityDescription>
Shoreline location in 1997 of mean high water (MHW) which is 0.34m above sea level by Virginia standards. The shoreline points were derived from the 1997 lidar data. All shoreline points were selected from lidar data that was gridded and smoothed into cross-shore profiles every 10m alongshore. The grids are broken up into segments alongshore of similar shoreline orientation. To view the segments open the VA_segments shapefile. With in each segment the cross-shore profiles every 10 m were named profile 1, profile 2, profile 3, etc. That profile value is reflected in the attribute table in the column labeled 'profile'. The lat and lon of each shoreline point is represented as well as northing and easting. The position of the shoreline is presented in a few columns. The cross-shore position of the shoreline is called 'xsl' which refers to meters inland from the position 0. The 0 position is located between the two segment points (VA_segments).

      <entityName>Bonnie_Overwashprob_98_05_09.zip</entityName>
      <entityDescription>
Polygon of overwash probability during a hypothetical storm with characteristics similar to Hurricane Bonnie in 1998. The bar to the west is the probability of overwash for the VCR based on 1998 lidar data. The middle bar is the 2005 overwash probability based on the 2005 lidar data. And the most east bar is the 2009 overwash probability to the hypothetical storm. The storm surge used was 1.1m, the significant water wave height was 3.7m and the period was 7s. The probability is in part determined by comparing the relative elevation of the most seaward dune crest (Dhigh) and the maximum wave runup (Rhigh). Dhigh elevations are given in the attribute table. Each elevation value is a mean value representing 100m alongshore. The elevation of the most seaward dune toe (Dlow) also represents mean dlow elevation along the same 100m. R2 is the 2% exceedence elevation the swash will reach during the hypothetical storm. That elevation is added to the surge (1.1m) to equal Rhigh. Then the probability is represented as a % of overwash probability for each 100m segment of beach.
