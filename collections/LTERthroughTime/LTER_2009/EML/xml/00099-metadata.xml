It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Juan Felipe</givenName><surName>Blanco</surName></individualName><organizationName>Universidad de Antioquia</organizationName><positionName>Research Associate</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales</deliveryPoint><city>Medellin</city><postalCode>00926-1119</postalCode><country>Colombia(SA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">+57-4-2105626</phone><phone phonetype="fax">voice</phone><electronicMailAddress>jfblanco73@yahoo.com</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

Sampling quadrats were placed &#732;1 m apart across the main channel (MC), and in five pairs along the side channel (SC). At SC, one quadrat of each pair was placed on the thalweg and another on the shallow part.  In addition, a random sample of individuals was collected from each quadrat to measure shell size. Shell size was measured as aperture width (straight line running along the columnella from the base of the operculum to the shell shoulder on body whorl). Total length (TL, perpendicular to AW) is related to aperture width (AW) but cannot be measured in individuals with broken outer lips (TL=1.24AW+0.04, r2=0.98).

Three sampling sites (reaches) in R&#237;o Mameyes near Route 3 Bridge were weekly to monthly sampled between August 2000 and December 2003.

Near-bed water velocity was measured at 2 cm above the streambed using a Marsh-McBirney flowmeter.  Each velocity measurement was averaged over 30 s and 3 to 5 measurements were made at each point.  Ten points every 1 m were sampled across MC.  Paired sampling points (thalweg vs. shallow) were measured in five cross sections along SC.

Four habitats (point-bar and straight channel pools, a riffle, and a high flow pond) in R&#237;o Mameyes near Route 3 Bridge were weekly sampled between August and December 2000. Water depth and substrate type were measured within each quadrat. The three-most abundant substrates were classified as boulders, cobbles, pebbles, gravel or sand/fines.

However, the factors controlling their population distribution and size are poorly understood. The migratory snail Neritina virginea (Gastropoda: Neritidae), abundant in estuaries and coastal rivers in the Caribbean, was studied to understand those factors. The objectives of the study were three-fold: 1) to identify the factors controlling the distribution of diadromous fauna at different spatial scales, 2) to determine patterns and causes of massive upstream migrations and their importance for population persistence, and 3) to integrate this knowledge into conservation strategies for migratory species and stream management plans.

After a survey of 32 coastal streams around Puerto Rico (Greater Antilles), it was evidenced that physical variables operating at different levels of the spatial hierarchy controlled longitudinal distribution of N. virginea. The hierarchically organized variables were river-ocean connectivity (regional scale), instream barriers and water chemistry (stream-network scale), habitat hydraulics (reach scale) and nearbed-flow roughness and depth (habitat scale). However, michohabitat scale distribution depended upon habitat and reach scale context. At habitat scale, water depth in pools, and nearbed flow roughness in riffles were the most important controls. At the reach scale, spatial heterogeneity among and within streambed patches was related to flow refugia, therefore controlling sensitivity of N. virginea density to flooding disturbances.

In addition, the role of structures (bridges) and maintenance activities (downstream channel realignment) associated to road crossings over streams was assessed. By splitting the stream channel and deflecting the flow, bridge pilings altered upstream migration routes. In particular, migratory individuals used more frequently boulder-and-cobble riffle reaches and avoided gravel-bed run reaches. Impact assessment of channel realignment over a 70 m reach in lower Rio Mameyes (NE Puerto Rico) showed that increase in frequency of fine sediment patches contributed to local population depletion and high mortality of juvenile individuals migrating upstream. As a consequence a population located 100 m upstream became isolated and did not recover from a crash caused by a major storm flood occurre after the channel realignment. In conclusion, distribution and size of populations of diadromous fauna such as N. virginea in coastal streams is influenced by hierarchically organized variables. By affecting variables at microhabitat to reach scales, road crossings over streams contribute to reduce longitudinal connectivity, and isolate upstream populations of N. virginea.</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout /></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>long-term_snailSizeDensityMameyesupRoute3.txt</entityName><entityDescription>snail size and density at Mameyes upstream Route 3 (longterm)</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>long-term_snailSizeDensityMameyesupRoute3.txt</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><physicalLineDelimiter>\n</physicalLineDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://luq.lternet.edu/data/lterdb151/data/long-term_snailSizeDensityMameyesupRoute3.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><references>geoReference</references></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage id="temporalReferencelong-term_snailSizeDensityMameyesupRoute3.txt" scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2000-08-22</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2003-12-05</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><method><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>Snails were collected, counted, and measured within 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats placed on the streambed as follow: snails on and under rocks were counted within 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats (n=10) placed on the streambed on a weekly basis.

Sampling quadrats were placed &#732;1 m apart across the main channel (MC), and in five pairs along the side channel (SC). At SC, one quadrat of each pair was placed on the thalweg and another on the shallow part.  In addition, a random sample of individuals was collected from each quadrat to measure shell size. Shell size was measured as aperture width (straight line running along the columnella from the base of the operculum to the shell shoulder on body whorl). Total length (TL, perpendicular to AW) is related to aperture width (AW) but cannot be measured in individuals with broken outer lips (TL=1.24AW+0.04, r2=0.98).

Three sampling sites (reaches) in R&#237;o Mameyes near Route 3 Bridge were weekly to monthly sampled between August 2000 and December 2003.

Near-bed water velocity was measured at 2 cm above the streambed using a Marsh-McBirney flowmeter.  Each velocity measurement was averaged over 30 s and 3 to 5 measurements were made at each point.  Ten points every 1 m were sampled across MC.  Paired sampling points (thalweg vs. shallow) were measured in five cross sections along SC.

Four habitats (point-bar and straight channel pools, a riffle, and a high flow pond) in R&#237;o Mameyes near Route 3 Bridge were weekly sampled between August and December 2000. Water depth and substrate type were measured within each quadrat. The three-most abundant substrates were classified as boulders, cobbles, pebbles, gravel or sand/fines. Plots covered &gt;1/3 by Elodea were classified as &#8220;mats&#8221;. Nearbed water velocity was measured along cross-sections within each habitat as described in the data set "Neritina snails upstream migrations"..

Discharge regime descriptors were calculated using data from USGS gage 50066000 located 50 m upstream of Route 3 bridge.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><references>geoReference</references></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><references>temporalReferencesnailSizeMameyesandGolfcourse.txt</references></temporalCoverage></coverage></studyExtent><samplingDescription><section><para><literalLayout>Weekly or monthly</literalLayout></para></section></samplingDescription></sampling></method><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Date of sampling</attributeName><attributeLabel>date</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>Date when sampling was performed (mm/dd/yy)</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><datetime><formatString>mm/dd/yy</formatString></datetime></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Sampling site</attributeName><attributeLabel>site</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>Sampling site in lower R&#195;&#173;o Mameyes</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Sampling site in lower R&#195;&#173;o Mameyes</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Downstream Route 3 Channel Type</attributeName><attributeLabel>downstreamRoute3ChanType</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>Channels located downstream from Route 3 at R&#195;&#173;o Mameyes before and after channel realignment</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Channels located downstream from Route 3 at R&#195;&#173;o Mameyes before and after channel realignment</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Shell; snail or individual size</attributeName><attributeLabel>size_mm</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>Measurement of Shell; snail or individual size; measured as aperture width</attributeDefinition><measurementScale><ratio><unit><standardUnit>millimeter</standardUnit></unit><precision>0.02</precision><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList></dataTable><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>habitatDistMameyesvsEspirituSanto.txt</entityName><entityDescription>habitat distribution Mameyes vs Espiritu Santo</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>habitatDistMameyesvsEspirituSanto.txt</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><physicalLineDelimiter>\n</physicalLineDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://luq.lternet.edu/data/lterdb151/data/habitatDistMameyesvsEspirituSanto.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><references>geoReference</references></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage id="temporalReferencehabitatDistMameyesvsEspirituSanto.txt" scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-06-10</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2003-07-03</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><method><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>Snails were collected, counted, and measured within 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats placed on the streambed as follow: snails on and under rocks were counted within 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats (n=10) placed on the streambed on a weekly basis.
