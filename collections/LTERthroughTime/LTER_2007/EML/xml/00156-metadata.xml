While there has been research on the effects of Rm thickets on physical and chemical environment, to this point, the functioning of Rm litter and ericoid mycorrhizas (ERM) has been unexplored. We examined the possibility of a N feedback between litter and ERM fungi in high elevation hardwood forests at the Coweeta hydrologic lab. Rm thickets increase leaf and root litter inputs and Rm soils contain two times as much C and eight times as much N in the organic horizons, compared to hardwood soils. Rm litter also has a greater capacity to create protein- tannin (P-T) complexes in laboratory assays. Together, these results suggest that the greater amount of organic matter and organic N under Rm is a function of litter quality and the formation of P-T complexes. While P-T complexes are recalcitrant, the mycorrhizal fungi of ericaceous plants, ERM fungi, have the ability to access this sequestered N via extra-cellular polyphenol oxidases (PPO). We found soil PPO activity to be significantly greater under Rm in the O horizons compared to hardwood soils. Rm litter polyphenols may create a pool of organic N that is recalcitrant to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) overstory recruits, yet remains available to Rm itself. However, an examination of the movement of N from P-T complexes into Rm biomass, compared on a relative basis with N movement into ECM and AM overstory trees is necessary to provide closure of this proposed positive feedback between Rm litter and ERM fungi. We propose a field tracer study using 15N labeled P-T complexes to quantify movement of 15N into soil pools and root biomass. Conducting this study in the field provides clear relevance to the research question as 1) microbial and mycorrhizal fungal communities will be unaltered, 2) ERM, ECM and AM roots coexist under Rm, and ECM and AM coexist in hardwood stands, 3) N inputs from the tracer in our plots can be placed into the context of N budgets estimated from our previous work.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>ant</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary1107_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Research will be conducted near the Coweeta Hydrologic Lab/Nantahala NF boundary at ~4800&#65533; (west of the watershed 28 boundary on the NW-facing slope of Big Butt, and east of road 83).</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2005-06-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2006-08-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
