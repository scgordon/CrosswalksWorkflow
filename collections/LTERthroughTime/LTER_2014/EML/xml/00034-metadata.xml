    <abstract>
      <para> Movements of common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) in the Shark River estuary were measured using passive acoustic telemetry. Snook were fitted with a V-16 acoustic transmitters, transmitters emit an ultrasonic pulse at random every 60 &#8211; 180 seconds that can be interpreted by autonomous listening stations dispersed throughout the Shark River estuary.  Once a listening station detects a transmitter, it records a time of detection and a unique tag ID.</para>

            <para>Passive acoustic tracking was used to quantify the movement patterns of individual snook.  to assess their use of upstream areas of the estuary in response to the marsh prey pulse. Snook were surgically fitted with a Vemco V16 transmitter (Vemco, Halifax, NS, Canada). Transmitters were set to emit a unique series of pulses for each shark at a random interval between 60 and 180 s (mean emission interval = 120 s). Movements of acoustically tagged sharks were tracked within an array of 43 Vemco VR2 and VR2W acoustic receivers. In situ measurements revealed mean detection ranges of receivers were c. 500 m. Each receiver was attached to a PVC pipe set in a 10-kg cement anchor. Data from receivers were downloaded every 3&#8211;4 months for the duration of the study, and batteries were replaced as needed.</para>

            <para>We captured snook using a boat-mounted, generator-powered electrofisher (two-anode, one cathode Smith-Root 9.0 unit) . Boat electrofishing is an effective sampling technique in freshwater habitats, including the Everglades, and has been used successfully to sample upper estuarine fish communities (Rehage and Loftus 2007). We conducted three replicate electrofishing bouts (timed sampling transects) at fixed locations in each site, each 200 m apart. For each bout, we ran the boat at idle speed at a randomly-selected creek shoreline and applied power for 5 min of time, during which two netters captured all immobilized fishes. We standardize power output to 1500 Watts, given temperature and conductance conditions measured at the beginning of each bout. </para>

          <para>Passive acoustic tracking was used to quantify the movement patterns of individual snook.  to assess their use of upstream areas of the estuary in response to the marsh prey pulse. Snook were surgically fitted with a Vemco V16 transmitter (Vemco, Halifax, NS, Canada). Transmitters were set to emit a unique series of pulses for each shark at a random interval between 60 and 180 s (mean emission interval = 120 s). Movements of acoustically tagged sharks were tracked within an array of 43 Vemco VR2 and VR2W acoustic receivers. In situ measurements revealed mean detection ranges of receivers were c. 500 m. Each receiver was attached to a PVC pipe set in a 10-kg cement anchor. Data from receivers were downloaded every 3&#8211;4 months for the duration of the study, and batteries were replaced as needed.</para>

        <abstract>
          <para>We are investigating how variability in regional climate, freshwater inputs, disturbance, and perturbations affect the coastal Everglades ecosystem. Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para>

          <abstract>
            <para>Our FCE I research focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacts with a marine source of phosphorus (P), the limiting nutrient, to control estuarine productivity where these two influences meet-in the oligohaline ecotone. This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these "upside-down" estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is:  In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.  Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

            <abstract>
              <para>Coastal ecosystems are being modified at unprecedented rates through interacting
pressures of global climate change and rapid human population growth, impacting natural coastal
resources and the services they provide. Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence
freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences,
coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual &#8220;upside-down&#8221; productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

      <datasetPurpose>
        <para>I aim to determine the relative importance of interannual variations in the hydrologic regime on tropical fish I) reproduction II) juvenile recruitment, and ultimately III) angler catch rates. I aim to conduct a six year field study tracking reproductive and recruitment dynamics of a popular tropical recreationally targeted species, snook. I will then relate these reproductive and recruitment dynamics to factors of the hydrologic regime that may vary across years.</para>

      <projectHypotheses>
        <para>Identifying mechanisms that contribute to the sustainability of South Florida fisheries are of the outmost importance. Given the strength of hydrology as a driver for tropical fishes, it is likely that deviations from tropical hydrologic regimes in South Florida are at least playing some role in driving the population performance of tropical fishes. Further, with the largest restoration effort ever attempted underway in the Everglades, it is critical to understand how exactly do freshwater inflows influence the system&#8217;s most valuable fisheries in order to predict how these fisheries may respond to this restoration effort and perhaps adjust management to benefit the fishery</para>
