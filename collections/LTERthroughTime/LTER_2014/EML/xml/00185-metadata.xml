<abstract>
<para>In this larger study, we are asking the question: Is old carbon that comprises the bulk of the soil organic matter pool released in response to thawing of permafrost?  We are answering this question by using a combination of field and laboratory experiments to measure net carbon exchange, radiocarbon isotope ratios in soil organic matter, soil respiration, and dissolved organic carbon, in tundra ecosystems.  The objective of these proposed measurements is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the SOM sources contributing to C losses following permafrost thawing.  We are making these measurements at  an established tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range.  Field measurements  center on a natural experiment where permafrost has been observed to warm and thaw over the past several decades.  This area represents a gradient of sites, each with a different degree of change due to permafrost thawing. In this area, we eatablished three sites with different degrees of disturbance from the permafrost thaw: 1) a relatively undisturbed tussock tundra (Minimal Thaw site), 2) a site adjacent to to the borehole which is monitoring permafrost thaw since 1985 with intermediate degree of disturbance (Moderate thaw site) and 3) a site where permafrost thaw apeared to have started more than three decades ago (Extensive thaw site) As such, this area is unique for addressing questions at the time and spatial scales relevant for change in arctic ecosystems.  This data set includes the active layer depth (ALD), which is the maximum seasonal thaw depth from each of the three sites mentioned before.</para>

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<para>The study site at the Eight Mile Lake watershed is located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range.  Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope at this site, in a 30 m deep borehole that was installed in 1985 before the permafrost started to thaw.  While permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding depending on local topography, this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands.  In this watershed, we monitored three sites that represented differing amounts of change as a result of permafrost thaw based on observations of ground subsidence and depth of thaw.  Our minimal thaw site had the shallowest summer thaw depth and the least ground surface subsidence, and the vegetation was typical moist acidic tundra, dominated by the tussock-forming sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, with coexisting deciduous and evergreen shrubs, and an understory of mosses and lichens.  A second site, located adjacent to the borehole, had moderate summer thaw depths and increased ground subsidence.  Here the vegetation composition was similar to our minimal thaw site, but with increased biomass of all plant groups.  Lastly, an extensive thaw site was located in an area where permafrost degradation had occurred at least several decades prior to the establishment of the borehole; thermokarst can already be observed in air photos of the area taken in 1954.  This site had the deepest summer thaw depth and the most ground subsidence, and the plant biomass has shifted to dominance by shrubs, including blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), at the expense of sedges. This dataset includes measurements of carbon fluxes at each site for several years.</para>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>FIELD:  Water table depth  was measured through the growing season of each reported year as the distance from the ground to the water surface in 3 water  wells located inside each gradient site (Ext = extensive thaw, Mod = moderate thaw and Min = Minimal thaw.  These measuremnts were taken until the end of the 2013 groging season.    LAB:  Data is screened in the lab and Qa/Qc is applied.  We present Thaw depth data measured at each site starting in 2004 until 2010. </para>
