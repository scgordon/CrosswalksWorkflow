<literalLayout> As part of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project 
in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, a systematic sampling program has been 
undertaken to monitor mass balance and meltwater flow from the Taylor Valley 
glaciers. This data set contains global positioning system (GPS) measurements of 
stakes on glaciers. The measurements include both low-quality estimates (+/- 
100m) from hand-held GPS units and high precision measurements (+/- 2 cm) using 
Trimble (4000 SSE) geodetic receivers. The purpose of these measurements was to 
obtain rough stake locations for use in relocating stakes in the future and 
precise stake locations for use in calculating stake displacement. The 
measurements are made relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid.

                        Data for the original stake locations was submitted by Andrew G. Fountain to the data manager in August, 
                        1997. The column showing "file name" identifies the original file containing that record. These are ascii 
                        text files and can be found in the McMurdo LTER data manager's home directory on INSTAAR's Unix system.
                        
                        Once submitted to INSTAAR, the data manager used Microsoft Excel and Access software to produce files 
                        that were in more of a relational mode. The resulting files are represented in the "glstkloc.dat" file (ascii text, 
                        comma delimited format), and "glstkloc.txt" file (MS-DOS text format).
                        
                        Initially, there was no date associated with each record in the data file. However, due to constant movement 
                        of ice on glaciers, the stake locations required subsequent measurements during the 1996-97 field season. 
                        When this occurred, a field for date was added to this file. Dates from the initial GPS measurements were 
                        acquired from the raw data files submitted by Andrew Fountain. If uncertain about what date to use, confirmation 
                        was made with Karen Lewis.
                        
                        Upon verifying altitude corrections for the gps locations with Bjorn Johns of UNAVCO (in March, 1998), Karen 
                        Lewis discovered that all of the ellipsoidal heights to sea level obtained by precise GPS measurements were 
                        too short by 55.24 meters. Denise Steigerwald therefore adjusted the elevations for these stakes by adding 55.24 meters.
                        
                        In April, 2000, Denise Steigerwald added fields for dataset code and glstkid. Dataset code would allow the data 
                        to be linked to the metadata in a relational database. Glstkid is a code that ties stake records to points on a GIS
                        base map being developed by Michael Prentice at the University of New Hampshire. In addition, Denise:
                        
                        * Removed records associated with "B" (replacement) stakes. Coordinates for these stakes match those provided 
                        for the original stakes. Data sets containing replacement stake records had their stake values divided into 'stake' 
                        and 'stk replcmnt' fields, thus allowing the 'stake' fields to be linked between the locations file and the data files.
                        * Converted all latitudes and longitudes from degrees-minutes-seconds to degrees in decimal format. This would 
                        allow them to be stored in numeric format rather than as text.

<para>
<literalLayout> Handheld measurements were acquired using either a NAVPRO 
5000 or GARMIN 45 GPS unit. Latitude and longitude accuracy are about +/- 100m. 
The handheld units did not provide adequately accurate elevations, so elevation 
was acquired from the 1971 map of the valley. There was no special procedure in 
acquiring the data or exact location relative to the stake.

The precise GPS measurements were acquired with help of
UNAVCO. (See photos and further 
descriptions below). Measurements were made using a Trimble 4000 SSE 
receiver. A base station was set up prior to measurements in the field. The 
baseline between the measurements and basestation did not exceed 15 km. The 
measurements were collected as rapid static surveys.

For the precise measurements, the GPS antenna was mounted on top of a 2 meter 
tall rangepole. The rangepole was placed next to the each ablation stake on the 
down-glacier side of the stake, and the tip of the rangepole was placed on the 
board used for mass balance measurements at that stake to insure that the 
measured elevation was relative to the same surface used in the mass balance 
measurements. This system resulted in the rangepole sitting 2-3 cm away from the 
down-glacier side of the ablation stake. Repeatibility of placement was 
ascertained to be about +/- 2 cm based on repeat measurements. The rangepole was 
always vertical, as indicated by a level-bubble.

At each stake, data were collected for 10 - 20 minutes, sufficient to keep 
the horizontal precision of the GPS results within 2 cm. Accuracy of the 
resulting measurements are estimated to be 5 cm in the horizontal and vertical, 
after accounting for set-up error.
 
During the 1995/96 season, the position of all the ablation stakes on four
different glaciers were measured using rapid-static GPS. A re-measurement
in the 1996/97 season provided displacements and velocities.
