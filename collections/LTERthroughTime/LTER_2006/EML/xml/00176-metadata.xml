The file format was suggested by the LTER data manager, to conform with the relational database structure. On 30-Oct-1998, the file was submitted to Denise Steigerwald, the MCM LTER data manager, located at INSTAAR, University of Colorado.
      
      Upon arrival at INSTAAR, the data manager combined the 3 data files, removed columns for latitude and longitude, and updated the location names to match those provided in the "soil measurement locations" file (from which latitude and longitude can be found). The resulting file was reformatted to present in ascii, comma delimited text and MS-DOS text (table layout) on the MCM LTER web site. Both of these files are linked to this web page above.</literalLayout></para></section></description></maintenance><contact scope="document"><organizationName>McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Mexico</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>MSC03 2020</deliveryPoint><city>Albuquerque</city><administrativeArea>NM</administrativeArea><postalCode>87131</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">505-277-3418</phone><phone phonetype="fax">505-277-0304</phone><electronicMailAddress>mcmdata@lternet.edu</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Department of Biology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of New Mexico</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>MSC03 2020</deliveryPoint><city>Albuquerque</city><administrativeArea>NM</administrativeArea><postalCode>87131</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">505-277-3418</phone><phone phonetype="fax">505-277-0304</phone><electronicMailAddress>mcmdata@lternet.edu</electronicMailAddress></publisher><methods><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>At each site 10-25 soil samples were taken for chlorophyll a analysis
 as follows:  Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and
 clean plastic scoop per sample.  The location of the sampling was recorded each
 year so that areas were not re-sampled.  Soil was collected to 1 cm depth with
 the plastic spoon, excluding rocks with a diameter &gt;5 mm.  About 4 teaspoons of soil were placed into the
vial, keeping the vial out of the light in a closed hand.  The soil samples were
stored in a light-tight bag, in a cooler for transportation.  On return to the
laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at +5 degrees C until
further processing.


Extraction of chlorophyll from the soil. All procedures were carried out
in the dark or very low irradiance to avoid degradation of the chlorophyll.  The
soil samples were mixed thoroughly in the vials, and a sample of approximately 5
g was weighed out into a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube with a screw-top cap.
10 mL of a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution was added to each sample and they
were mixed thoroughly on a bench-top Vortex mixer for about 5 seconds.  The
vials were placed in a -4 degrees C constant temperature room, in the dark, and left for
12-18 hours.


Determination of chlorophyll-a concentration.  This was determined
fluorometrically using a Turner model 111 fluorometer.  A calibration using a
known concentration of chlorophyll was carried out prior to sample analysis.
The machine was blanked using a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution.  Each vial was
mixed thoroughly, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at about 1800 RPM.  A sample of
approximately 4 mL of the DMSO/acetone solution was taken from the top of the
sample with a pipette, being careful not to get any soil particles in the
solution.  The sample was placed in a cuvette, into the fluorometer and the
fluorescence was recorded.  This was done fairly quickly in order to prevent
light from breaking down the chlorophyll.  This measurement is called Fo, the
initial fluorescence.  After taking this reading, 0.1 mL of 1N HCl was added
directly to the cuvette and the cuvette was gently agitated.  After 20 seconds,
the fluorescence was re-measured.  (During this step, the acid converts the
chlorophyll to phaeophytin by releasing a magnesium ion in an acidic
environment).  This measurement is called Fa, the fluorescence after
acidification.  The solution was discarded into a waste container, and the
cuvette rinsed 3 times with DMSO/90% acetone solution before proceeding with the
next sample.  

Calculation of chlorophyll concentration.  The calibration curve that was
constructed for the fluorometer had the following equation:  [chlorophyll (microg/L)
= (Fo-Fa)-0.4254)/2.2385].  The Fo and Fa figures were put in to this equation
to calculate chlorophyll concentration.  Subsequently, this figure was divided
by 1000 to convert to microg/mL.  Next, this is multiplied by 10 as the soil was
extracted in 10mL of DMSO/90% acetone.  Finally, this is divided by the fresh
weight of the soil in g to give the concentration in microg chlorophyll per g fresh
weight of soil.  If the extract was diluted prior to reading on the fluorometer,
the dilution factor (noted in the comments column) was applied at the end of the
equation.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>Units_and_Column_Descriptions</entityName><physical scope="document"><objectName>Units_and_Column_Descriptions</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><numFooterLines>0</numFooterLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter><quoteCharacter>"</quoteCharacter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://www.mcmlter.org/data/soils/short-term/gsca.dat</url></online></distribution></physical><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>LOCATION</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Name of area where measurement was made</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Name of area where measurement was made</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>DATE</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Date on which sample was gathered</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Date" /><measurementScale><dateTime><formatString>mm/dd/yy</formatString></dateTime></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>SAMPLE#</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Sample ID</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Sample ID</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>CHLOROPHYLL A (MICROG/G SOIL)</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Chlorophyll a concentration found in soil</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Number" /><measurementScale><ratio><unit><customUnit>microg/gsoil</customUnit></unit><numericDomain><numberType>real</numberType></numericDomain></ratio></measurementScale><missingValueCode><code>Required Entry</code><codeExplanation>None given</codeExplanation></missingValueCode></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>COMMENTS</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Helpful hints about the sample</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Helpful hints about the sample</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>FILE NAME</attributeName><attributeDefinition>Name of file in which data was stored</attributeDefinition><storageType typeSystem="Text" /><measurementScale><nominal><nonNumericDomain><textDomain><definition>Name of file in which data was stored</definition></textDomain></nonNumericDomain></nominal></measurementScale></attribute></attributeList></dataTable></dataset><additionalMetadata><metadata><unitList><unit id="microg/gsoil" /></unitList></metadata></additionalMetadata></eml:eml>
