    <para>Increases in soil temperature and moisture may change the bioavailability of essential elements 
      by altering solubility and diffusion rates in soils, or by changing the amounts of organic compounds. Long-term 
      experiments in the Bonney, Hoare and Fryxell basins have been established with 3 treatments: 1) increased moisture, 
      2) soil warming (ITEX chambers), and 3) soil warming + increased moisture. The identification and abundance of 
      soil biota are reported.</para>

    <title>Notes about the attribute table</title>
    <para>
     <literalLayout> Since the attribute table for this dataset is very large, the user must construct the actual column
      name.  The FIRST letter represents the species, and the following letters represent the life stage/sex/sum type.  The nermatode
      species codes are:
      
      S: Scottnema lindsayae 
      E: Eudorylaimus spp. 
      P: Plectus spp.  
      
      For example, in the attribute table,  "(code)ML" has the description "The total number of living male (species) adult nematodes extracted
      from the soil sample in number of organisms per kg soil oven dry weight equivalent. In this case, a column name 
      called "SML" would be  "The total number of living male Scottnema lindsayae adult nematodes..."</literalLayout>

   <section>
    <title>TREATMENT Codes</title>
    <para>
     <literalLayout> In the attribute table, the treatment is the manipulation for a give plot from where the soil was collected. The treatments are:
      (C) control plots (no manipulations), 
      (T) enhanced soil temperature using ITEX conical open-top chambers made of solar fiberglass,
      (W) Nanopure water added to field capacity to 10 cm depth (5.6 L/plot) once per season,
      (TW) temperature enhancement and water addition

     <title>General Methods</title>
     <para>
      <literalLayout>Three sites were chosen on generally flat areas of moderately patterned soil. Plots were laid out in an identical design at each site - there are 4 treatments replicated 6 times in blocks. Treatments were randomly assigned to the plots within each block. Each plot measures 1m x 1m (with a 0.83m diameter area within used for experimental treatments and analyses) and there is a 1m buffer strip between adjacent plots. Plots are delineated by nails in the soil, each site is marked by PVC stakes approximately 60cm high. ITEX fiberglass chambers are used to impose the temperature treatment (see Marion et al. citation above). Water treatments are applied annually at a rate of 5.6L per plot. When sites were established, 5 cotton strips per plot were inserted vertically in to the soil. These will be sampled in subsequent seasons to measure decomposition.
       Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and moisture content analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Samples were taken from within the 10 cm diameter circular area of each plot. The location of the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not re-sampled. Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to 10 cm depth. Very large rocks (greater than 20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at 5C until further processing.
       In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening. Approximately 200cm3 of soil was placed in a pre-weighed 800mL plastic beaker. Rocks greater than 3-4mm in diameter were removed from the sample. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum dish, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105C for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil and to express data as numbers of soil organisms per unit dry weight of soil. The remaining soil in the plastic beaker was weighed. Cold tap water was added up to 650 mL. The soil suspension was stirred carefully (star stir or figure of 8) for 30 seconds, using a spatula. Immediately the liquid was poured into wet screens - a stack of 40 mesh on top of a 400 mesh. The screens were rinsed gently with ice cold tap water (from a wash bottle) through the top of the stack, keeping the screens at an angle as the water filtered through. The water was kept on ice at all times. The top screen was removed, and the lower screen rinsed top down, never directly on top of the soil, but at the top of the screen and from behind. The water was allowed to cascade down and carry the particles into the bottom wedge of the angled screen. The side of the screen was tapped gently to filter all the water through. The suspension was rinsed from the front and the back, keeping the screen at an angle and not allowing the water to overflow the edge of the screen. The soil particles were backwashed into a 50mL plastic centrifuge tube, tipping the screen into the funnel above the tube and rinsing the funnel gently. The suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at 1744 RPM. The liquid was decanted, leaving a few mL on top of the soil particles. The tube was filled with sucrose solution (454g sucrose per liter of tap water, kept refrigerated) up to 45mL. This was stirred gently with a spatula until the pellet was broken up and suspended. The suspension was centrifuged for one minute at 1744 RPM, decanted into a wet 500 mesh screen, rinsed well with ice cold tap water and backwashed into a centrifuge tube. Samples were refrigerated at 5C until counted. Samples were washed in to a counting dish and examined under a microscope at x10 or x20 magnification. Rotifers and tardigrades were identified and counted. Nematodes were identified to species and sex, and counted. Total numbers in each sample were recorded on data sheets. All species of nematode, and all rotifers and tardigrades found in the sample were recorded. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors.
       
       For measurements of electrical conductivity 100ml of DI water was added to 20g of soil in a clean, DI- rinsed glass beaker (coarse fragments &gt;3-4 mm were removed). The samples were stirred until thoroughly mixed (about 5-10 sec). After sitting to equilibrate for 10 minutes the samples were stirred again and a reading was taken with a Corning 311 conductivity meter. The values reported are temperature corrected using the following equation: (1,411.8/.01M KCl reading) * sample reading. The 0.01M KCl reading is obtained by measuring the conductivity of a 0.01M KCl solution at the beginning of the 10 minute reading. For measurements of pH, 60 ml of DI water was added to 30 g of soil in a clean, DI- rinsed glass beaker (coarse fragments &gt;2 mm were removed). The samples were stirred until thoroughly mixed (about 5-10 sec). After sitting to equilibrate for 2 hours, the samples were stirred again and a reading was taken with an Orion 720A pH meter. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors.
       
       Extraction of chlorophyll from the soil. All procedures were carried out in the dark or very low irradiance to avoid degradation of the chlorophyll. The soil samples were mixed thoroughly in the vials, and a sample of approximately 5 g was weighed out in to a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube with a screw-top cap. 10 mL of a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution was added to each sample and they were mixed thoroughly on a bench-top Vortex mixer for about 5 seconds. The vials were placed in a -4C constant temperature room, in the dark, and left for 12-18 hours.
       Determination of chlorophyll a concentration - This was determined fluorometrically using a Turner model 111 fluorometer. A calibration using a known concentration of chlorophyll was carried out prior to sample analysis. The machine was blanked using a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution. Each vial was mixed thoroughly, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at about 1800 RPM. A sample of approximately 4mL of the DMSO/acetone solution was taken from the top of the sample with a pipette, being careful not to get any soil particles in the solution. The sample was placed in a cuvette, in to the fluorometer and the fluorescence was recorded. This was done fairly quickly in order to prevent light from breaking down the chlorophyll. This measurement is called Fo, the initial fluorescence. After taking this reading, 0.1 mL of 1N HCl was added directly to the cuvette and the cuvette was gently agitated. After 20 seconds, the fluorescence was re-measured. (During this step, the acid converts the chlorophyll to phaeophytin by releasing a magnesium ion in an acidic environment). This measurement is called Fa, the fluorescence after acidification. The solution was discarded in to a waste container, and the cuvette rinsed 3 times with DMSO/90% acetone solution before proceeding with the next sample. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors.

			<para><literalLayout>Comments: 
Soil samples were taken on 9 Dec 1999 from the Lake Bonney 
Biotic Effect Experiment (BEE) site at the West Lobe of  Lake Bonney in Taylor Valley by Dorota Porazinska and Katie 
Catapano.  The BEE was established on the same day prior to sampling.  Each sample  was collected from the area outside 
of a warming chamber but still within the borders of the experimental plots. Soil samples were processed on 10 Dec 99 by Katie Catapano, Dorota Porazinska, and Steve Blecker. 

[DP 11 Dec 99].  On 9 Nov 2000, Mike Robertson renamed the "data" worksheet to "raw" and enabled protection for the 
worksheet.  The worksheet was also copied to create a "calc" sheet.  Formulas were copied from an earlier ".worms" worksheet to calculate the number of individuals 
per kg of soil for each taxon [MR 9 Nov 2000].

Soil samples were taken on 4 Dec 1999 from the Lake Fryxell 
Biotic Effect Experiment (BEE) site at the south side of 
Lake Fryxell in Taylor Valley (by F6 hut) by Dorota 
Porazinska, Katie Catapano, Ross Virginia, and John 
Barrett. The BEE was established on the same day prior 
sampling.  Each sample was collected from the area outside 
of a warming chamber but still within the borders of 
experimental plots. Soil samples were processed on 5 Dec 99 
by Katie Catapano, Dorota Porazinska, and John Barrett. [DP 
11 Dec 99].  On 9 Nov 2000, Mike Robertson renamed the 
"data" worksheet to "raw" and copied this sheet to make a

Soil samples were taken on 20 Dec 2001 from the Lake Bonney 
Biotic Effects Experiment (BEE) site at the south side of 
the west lobe of Lake Bonney by Dorota Porazinska, Nicole 
DeCrappeo, and Steve Blecker.  Sampling for each plot was 
done as follows: chla samples were taken from the soil 
surface (top 2 cm) around the cotton strip using a spoon; 
one cotton strip was then gently pulled, shaken to remove 
any loose soil, and wrapped in Al foil (strips were taken 
from the point farthest from the lake--however, in chamber 
plots the strips were difficult to find due to sediment 
accumulation, so the first strip seen was removed).  A soil 
sample was then taken using a scoop and Whirlpak bag from 
the place where the cotton strip was removed.  5T chamber 
shifted north, so that 2 cotton strips were not inside the 
chamber.  6C had only one cotton strip in the plot, the 
other 5 blew away.  Soil surface was not marked on the 
cotton strips in the field but estimated in the lab during 
processing.  Plots were maintained on the same day right 
after sampling (water added to appropriate treatments, 
chambers repositioned, and bungees tightened where 
necessary).  Samples were placed in a cooler in the field, 
brought back to Crary and immediately placed in a 4C 
refrigerator until processing.  Soil samples were processed 
on 21 Dec 01 by Dorota Porazinska, Nicole DeCrappeo, and

New chambers were put on the plots 28 Dec 01 and were 
replaced with the old ones by Jeb and Andy on 6 Jan 02.  

The new chambers seemed to be of a different composite 
material (flimsier), harnesses did not seem secure enough, 
so the old chambers will be left on all the BEE plots.

Soil samples were processed on 7 Jan 03 by Diana Wall, Andy 
Parsons and Steve Blecker. NOTE: Due to the vague 
nomenclature in the "blue methods book", the samples were 
extracted using a sugar solution prepared by adding 454 lb. 
of sugar to 1 L of water (specific gravity 1.135 g/cc) 
instead bringing 454 g of sugar to 1L of volume (1.171 g/cc 
and 1.33M), the latter being the correct formulation as per 
Freckman and Virginia (1993).  [SwB 8 Jan 03]. 

A ca 100g subsample was extracted using the standard sugar 
centrufigation method.

Samples were taken on 9 January 2003 by Diana Wall, Byron 
Adams, Andy Parsons and Jeb Barrett from the F6 BEE plots.  
Standard soil sampling for Antarctic samples was employed,  
with the following details added for clarification. The 
strip closest to 9 o'clock was sampled, with 12 o'clock 
being in a northerly direction. Chla samples were taken 
first, then the cotton strip was removed as gently as 
possible, any clumps of soil gently removed and then 
wrapped in Al-foil, then about 1/2 a large whirl pak worth 
of soil was excavated with a plastic scoop to 10cm, either 
in the spot the cotton strip was removed, or closer to the 
9 o'clock location. Some of the strips in Blocks 1 and 2 
were frozen in to the ground and the soil around them had 
to be excavated prior to removal. 2 strips were torn during 
removal but both pieces were retrieved. Several of the 
strips in the +T treatments were buried by new sediment 
accumulation, this had to be carefully brushed aside to 
find the strips. Steve says this best: "Locating cotton 
strips in the chambered plots was difficult at best.  The 
eolian sediment was scraped away as gently as possible in 
an effort to locate all the strips (necessary to determine 
which strip to sample), but orignal surface soil and coarse 
fragments were disturbed in the process. Recommend that the 
location of the strips me marked with a flag or nail that 
sticks above accumulating sediments so the plots do not 
have to be disturbed so heavily.  Note: the eolian sediment 
was not sampled."

Samples were placed in backpacks and flown back to the 
Crary Lab where they were stored at +4C until analysis.

A ca 100g subsample was extracted using the standard sugar 
centrufigation method. Samples were extracted on 10 January 
2003. Samples were counted by Diana Wall on 10 Jan 03 and 
11 Jan 03.  [AnP 15 Jan 03].

Soil samples were collected on a mild day, from the BEE 
expt at F6, on 27 Dec 2004 by Holley Zadeh, with 
bagging/labling/keeping-track-of-the-plots assistance from 
John Chaston. Claire Ojima and Emma Broos removed cotton 
strips. Holley and Emma treated W and TW plots with water. 
Soil samples were taken from the top left corner (not all 
the way to the corner) of the plots as you look at them 
facing North and Lake Fryxell. In the case of a temperature 
chamber, samples were pulled from within the chamber. 
Several cotton strips were unrecoverable at this site, due 
to a large amount of sediment (~10cm deep, but some had 
more than others). Plots with unrecoverable strips are as 
follows:

1T
2TW
3TW
4T
5TW
1TW
6T

Big storm came in and we got outta there just in time!

*Sample 4C had a tear in the bag from the field. The 
sample, in it's original bag, was placed in a clean ziplock 
bag once we got back to the lab, and the original bag was 
taped over the hole. When it was double bagged, the ziplock 
was removed and the taped bag with the hole was placed 
directly into the second bag.

NOTE: chambers used to replace old ones on all BEE plots 
are 2" taller than the ones that were removed.

Samples were extracted on 28 Dec 04 as follows:

*Holley weighed and recorded soils
*Emma Broos seived each sample
*Claire Ojima worked the centrifuge, added sugar solution, 
and acted as a runner in her downtime
*John Chaston was at the microscope and doing PCR work
Emma and John counted these samples on 28 &amp; 29 Dec 04.

 F6 BEE 3C was re-run on 7 Jan 05, in the same way as 
listed above. Specimens were not counted, however, because 
we only wanted a Scottnema sample out of it for DNA work.

Nematodes were converted to # per kg in the calc sheet, 
using the equation: 1000*(# in extr/ (fresh soil in extr - 
(fresh soil in extr * (moist % / 100)))), and soil 
moistures were added for this calculation from 
F6BEE_soil.xls [HZ 8 Jan 05].

All specimens were preserved on 4 Jan 2005 by EB and HZ. 
[HZ 23 Jan 05]

Error found in row 27 of calc sheet. Should read 100.65, 
not 10.65. Corrected by Breana Simmons. E-mail sent to B424 
and B423 [BS 13 July 06].

Soil was sampled from the BEE plots on the South side of 
Lake Hoare by John Chaston and Claire Ojima on 23 Dec 04, 
and decomp strips were gently removed with a metal spatula 
by Emma Broos, while HZ assisted by checking plot numbers 
and labels and wrapping cotton strips in foil (after gently 
removing any soil clumped on to the strip); and 'W' plots 
were treated with water by EB and Holley Zadeh. Samples 
were flown back to the Crary lab the same day and incubated 
in the 4 degree until time for extraction.

NOTE: chambers used to replace old ones on all BEE plots 
are 2" taller than the ones that were removed.

Samples were extracted on 26 Dec 04 as follows:
*Holley weighed and recorded soils
*Emma Broos sieved each sample
*Claire Ojima worked the centrifuge, added sugar solution, 
and acted as a runner in her downtime
*John Chaston was at the microscope and doing PCR work

Emma and John counted these samples on 26 &amp; 27 Dec 04.

Sample LHBEE 1TW contained 6 dead juvenile worms with  
unique morphological characteristics. This soil was 
extracted two more times to try to find the same worm, but 
it was not found again with either extraction, so the worm 
was not positively ID'd [HZ 5 Jan 05].

Comments from JC regarding sample LHBEE 5TW: accurate 
account, but I erased the numbers on the counter before 
recording them. They were counted two days later, so maybe 
some remained in the tube; I thought it was more like 
3,0,5,1,3,2, for Scottnema numbers

Samples were preserved on 4 Jan 05 by Emma Broos and John 

Chaston. Sample LH_BEE 2T was dropped on the bench and only 
partial sample remains. Was preserved anyway, and this 
sample was not re-run [HZ 5 Jan 05].

Nematodes were converted to # per kg in the calc sheet, 
using the equation: 1000*(# in extr/ (fresh soil in extr - 
(fresh soil in extr * (moist % / 100)))), and soil 
moistures were added for this calculation from

Comments: 
These data are for soils collected by Diana Wall and Holley 
Zadeh. Emma Broos kept track of soil sample kits and 
sampling locations, cotton strip foil, and made notes in 
the field book. Byron Adams poured water on treatments, as 
well as maintained the HOBO. Johnny "The Mule" Chaston 
replaced soil warming chambers, hauled soils back to the 
coolers at the helo pad, and generally hoofed things back 
and forth. Claire Ojima and Emma Broos collected bundt pan 
samples while JC and HZ collected OTC sediments. HZ took 
over for EB on the bundt pans at #5, and by #7 HZ and CO 
saw that the soil was wet, and by #8 they saw that 
Wormherder Creek was full-on flowing. 

BEE plot samples were collected at ~1:00, with the lake as 
12:00. Exceptions are 6C and 6T, which were both sampled at 
2:00, and 6W, which was sampled at 12:00. All but one 
cotton strip was collected: 1TW was not found. 

NOTE: chambers that were used to replace the old beaten 
ones on all BEE plots are 2" taller than the ones that were 
removed.

Specimens were extracted on 21 Jan 2005 as follows:
*HZ and CO under the laminar flow weighing out ext'n soil 
and pH/EC soil
*Diana "fast-track" Wall sieved soil at the sink
*Byron "poor shot of the day" Adams spun samples at the 
centrifuge while making only approximately 4 of 50 
attempted shots to the burnables can
*JC and EB counted samples at the scope

All specimens were preserved by EB on 23 Jan 2005 [HZ 23 
Jan 2005]

The Microbial Biomass samples were extracted in 50 mls of 
K2SO4. [RMS 22 Jan 05]

#s/kg were calculated by Holley Zadeh on 11 May 2005 [11 
May 05].

All soil samples for nematodes and chloropyll A were 
collected by Ed Ayres and Dorota Porazinska on 10 Jan 07. 
Samples were collected at 2:30 direction at each 
experimental plot. CA single cotton strip was removed only 
from plots without ITEX chambers (W, C), leaving one more 
cotton strip in place. Plot4C contained only one strip and 
so no more cottons strips were left for future sampling. 

Plots with chambers accumulated so much soil sediment that 
cotton strips were not visible and thus not accessible.  

Immediately after soil samples and coton strips were 
collected, 5.6 L of water was apllied to apropriate 
exeprimental treatments (W, TW). Regular maintenance was 
carried out.

Fauna were extracted by sugar floatation.  Raw data were 
converted by Ed using (# individuals/(fresh soil wy 
extracted/((soil moisture/100)+1)))*1000

Soil, chlorophyll a and cotton strip (where posible) 
samples were collected by Ed Ayres and Dorota Proazinska on 
13 Jan 07.  Plots were sampled at the '2:30' position if 12 
o'clock is towards the lake.  Water addition treatments 
were applied to the W and TW plots immediately after 
sampling.

Fauna were extracted by sugar floatation.  Raw data was 
converted by Ed using (# individuals/(fresh soil wt 
extracted/((soil moisture/100)+1)))*1000
