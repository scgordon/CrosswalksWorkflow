The Toolik Lake Field Station (TLFS) and Sagavanirktok River-Department of Transportation camp (SDOT) sites were deglaciated ~65,000 yr BP, following the Itkillik I glaciation (Hamilton 2002).  The Imnavait Creek (IMVT) site was deglaciated ~120,000 yr BP, following the Sagavanirktok River glaciation (Hamilton 2002).  Snow cameras were mounted on tripod assemblages, ~ 5 meters from the ground to capture landscape-level images four times daily in the Shrub plots at each of the four sites.  The  Shrub plots represent a gradient of shrub statures, with maximum deciduous shrub heights of approximately 22 cm (IMVT), 35 cm (TLFS) and 84 cm (SDOT) (Rich et al. 2013).  Differences among Shrub plots are related to topography and water flow.  The IMVT Shrub plot, which has the shortest shrubs of the three sites, is associated with water movement because it is located in an area with water tracks, and the site represents vegetation typical of water track tundra as described in Chapin et al. (1988).  The TLFS Shrub plot, which has medium stature shrubs, is located at the outlet of Toolik Lake, where proximity to a large body of water, substrate conditions, and the presence of large rocks may promote root lengthening and shrub growth.  The TLFS Shrub plot represents vegetation typical of shrub tundra described in Shaver &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Chapin (1991).  The SDOT Shrub plot, which has tall and structurally complex shrubs, is a riparian community (Rich et al. 2013).  The Shrub plot at SDOT has the deepest thaw depths among all of our plots and represents vegetation typical of riverside shrub tundra as described in Giblin et al. (1991), which tend to have deeper thaw depths compared to other tundra vegetation communities (Shaver &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Chapin 1991).  

Snow cameras are installed in mid-May and digital photos are used to quantify snow cover through the melt period.  Cameras rented from SID Inc. are removed and shipped back to SID Inc. once snowmelt in the field of view of the camera is complete (or near complete, &lt;5% snow cover remaining). The photos are taken every day, either once or three times per day, depending on the site and camera being used. The following describes the cameras being used at each field site. The photos show what their field of view should be when set up each year, and the below table gives a summary of which camera(s) was (were) used in which year at each site.

TLFS:    We are using two cameras at this field site: (1) the EDC&#8217;s Brooks Range Camera which is an Axis 206W Wireless Network Camera.  The system is permanently mounted inside Winter Quarters and faces south towards the Brooks Mountain Range and takes a photo every day at 12 noon. Field of view of the camera can be seen at the following URL: http://toolik.alaska.edu/edc/daily_images/web_cam_archive.php?camera=brooks);   (2) our own camera rented from SID Inc. (NetCam SC, StarDOT Technologies, CA, USA).  The camera is mounted at 3.32 m above ground and is located upslope of our Shrub plots at TLFS and takes a photo every day at approximately 6am, 12 noon and 6pm.

IMVT:     We are using our own camera rented from SID Inc. (NetCam SC, StarDOT Technologies, CA, USA).  The camera is mounted at 3.54 m above ground and is located upslope of our Shrub plots at IMVT and takes a photo every day at approximately 6am, 12 noon and 6pm.
 
SDOT:     We are using our own camera rented from SID Inc. (NetCam SC, StarDOT Technologies, CA, USA).  The camera is mounted at 3.32 m above ground and is located south of and adjacent to our Shrub plots at SDOT and takes a photo every day at approximately 6am, 12 noon and 6pm.

Post-processing and analysis of photos was done using ENVI remote sensing software and in Excel, and the fraction of snow cover in each image on each day was calculated:  Fraction snow cover = (# snow covered pixels) / (# snow covered pixels + # snow free pixels). This was converted to a percent by multiplying by 100.

The goal of Arctic LTER project is to predict the future ecological characteristics of the site based upon our knowledge of the controls of ecosystem structure and function as exerted by physical setting and geologic factors, climatic factors, biotic factors, and the changes in fluxes of water and materials from land to water. To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches:

Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. 

Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. 

Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

          <geographicCoverage>
            <geographicDescription>The Arctic LTER research site (68&#176;N and 149&#176;W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities.</geographicDescription>
