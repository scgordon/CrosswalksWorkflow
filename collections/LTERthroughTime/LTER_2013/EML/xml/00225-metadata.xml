    <section>
      <para> This data set was collected to provide data for comparison of the losses
 of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in the runoff from grass- and shrub-
 dominated plots in the Jornada Basin of southern New Mexico. This dataset
 contains the following columns:

 Plot: the identification number for the plots, which are grouped
 for grass, shrub or intershrub areas.

 Fill Time: the time in seconds used to collect an individual
 sample of discharge from the plot.

 Time: the time in minutes (from the beginning of the rainfall
 simulation) at which each individual collection of discharge
 began. In each case, the first time listed is the time at which
 discharge was first observed.

 Time b/w samples: the time in seconds between the beginning the
 collection of a given sample of discharge and the beginning of
 the next collection.

 Q: the rate of discharge during each collection, in cubic
 centimeters per second.

 AveQ/time: the total discharge during an interval in cubic
 centimeters. For example, the discharge between 16 and 20
 minutes is calculated as the mean of the discharge at l6 and 20
 minutes multiplied by 4 minutes.

 InorgN-rain (adjusted inorganic N): the concentration of NH4-N + NO3-N in
 the discharge sample collected, corrected for the sum of the
 concentration of these ions in the simulated rainfall applied.
 Concentration is given in milligrams per liter for N contained in
 the sum of these forms. Analysis for NH4-N and NO3-N was
 performed using the Bran-Luebbe Traacs 800 Autoanalyzer, as
 detailed in Schlesinger et al. (l999).

 Total N-rain (adjusted total N): the concentration of total dissolved
 N in the discharge sample collected, corrected for the
 concentration of total dissolved N in the simulated rainfall
 applied. Concentration is given in milligrams per liter of total
 dissolved N in the sample. The concentration of total dissolved
 N was performed using the Traacs 800 Autoanalyzer, following a
 persulfate digestion of the sample, as detailed in Schlesinger et
 al. (l999).

 OrgN-rain (adjusted organic N): the concentration of N contained in
 dissolved organic forms, corrected for the concentration of
 dissolved organic N in the simulated rainfall applied. Dissolved
 organic N is calculated as the difference, in any sample, between
 the total dissolved N and the sum of NH4-N and NO3-N. Values are
 in milligrams per liter.

 Total P-rain (adjusted total P): the concentration of total dissolved
 phosphorus, corrected for the concentration of total dissolved
 phosphorus in the simulated rainfall applied, both in milligrams
 per liter.

 Org-P-rain (adjusted org P): the concentration of dissolved organic
 phosphorus, corrected for the concentration of dissolved organic
 phosphorus in the simulated rainfall applied, both in milligrams
 per liter.

 Inorg-N-rain (adjusted inorganic N), the yield in grams of NH4-N plus
 NO3-N in the discharge collected.

 TotalN-rain (adjusted total N), the yield in grams of total dissolved
 N in the discharge collected.

 OrgN-rain (adjusted organic N), the yield in grams of forms of dissolved
 organic N in the discharge collected.

 Total P-rain (adjusted total P), the yield in grams of total dissolved
 phosphorus in the discharge collected.

 OrgP-rain (adjusted organic P), the yield in grams of forms of dissolved
 organic phosphorus in the discharge collected.

 InorgN-rain (adjusted inorganic N) load, is the rate of loss, in grams per
 second, of the sum of NH4-N plus NO3-N during the period of the
 sample collection.

 Total N-rain (adjusted total N) load, is the rate of loss, in grams
 per second, of total dissolved N during the period of the sample
 collection.

 OrgN-rain (adjusted organic N) load, is the rate of loss, in grams per
 second, of dissolved organic N during the period of the sample
 collection.

 Total P-rain (adjusted total P) load, is the rate of loss, in grams
 per second, of total dissolved P during the period of the sample
 collection.

 Org-P-rain (adjusted organic P) load, is the rate of loss, in grams per
 second, of dissolved organic P during the period of the sample
 collection.</para>

      <title>Data Policies</title>
      <para>
        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout> Rainfall simulations in the grassland were performed on six plots,
 each 1 x 2 m in dimension. Plant cover in each of these plots was
 about 50%, composed of individual clumps of Bouteloua eriopoda, which
 are typically each about 20 cm in diameter. In the shrubland, 1 x 1 m
 plots were centered on individual shrubs (n=8) or in bare areas between
 shrubs (n=10). The 1 x 1 m size was selected for these plots so that
 the shrub plots would not extend beyond the perimeter of the shrub
 canopy.
 A field-portable rainfall simulator, developed and described by Luk
 et al. (1986), was used to apply water at a nominal rate of 140 mm/hr
 to these plots. This simulator delivers rainfall with 90% of the kinetic
 energy of natural rainfall and a comparable drop-size distribution. All
 rainfall simulations were performed during the dry season, during June
 1995 and 1996, on initially dry soils. Each simulation lasted 30 minutes,
 and the actual rainfall delivered to each plot was measured in an array of
 6 wedge-shaped raingages located around the periphery of each plot. The
 mean rainfall intensity was 146, 118, and 136 mm/hr during the rainfall
 simulations on grassland, shrub, and intershrub plots, respectively.
 Runoff rates (discharge) were determined by taking timed volumetric
 samples of the water discharged from a trough placed along the lowest side
 of the plot. Once runoff commenced, it increased rapidly, so samples of
 the outflow were initially collected at 30-s intervals. Later in the
 experiment, when runoff stabilized, samples were collected at longer
 intervals ranging from 2 to 4 min. Samples were collected in polypropylene
 bottles. The duration of the sampling lasted 15 s early in the experiment
 and ranged from 20 to 30 s later in the experiment, depending on the fill
 time of the sample bottle. Following each simulation, the surface cover of
 fines (i.e., materials = 2 mm), plant
 litter, and vegetation was estimated for each plot using a grid of 200
 points.
 Runoff samples were filtered through pre-rinsed 0.45 micron Millipore
 HA filters, and analyzed for NH4, NO3, and PO4 using standard methods
 on a Traacs 800 Autoanalyzer. Inorganic N is taken as the sum of NH4-N
 + NO3-N. Each sample was then subjected to a persulfate digestion
 (D'Elia et al. 1977) and reanalyzed. The difference between the digested
 and undigested concentrations is assumed to represent dissolved organic
 forms of N and P. Contents of N and P in the applied water were subtracted
 from the contents in runoff to estimate the net losses in runoff.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
