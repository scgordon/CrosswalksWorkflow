			<abstract>This dataset contains data collected within limestone cedar glades at Stones River National Battlefield (STRI) near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This dataset contains measurements of soil pH at certain quadrat locations (points) within 12 selected cedar glades. These measurements were obtained according to the following protocol: (1) for each quadrat location (point), one soil sample was obtained under sterile conditions, using a trowel wiped with methanol and rinsed with distilled water, and was placed into an autoclaved jar with a tight-fitting lid and placed on ice, (2) soil samples were transported to lab facilities on ice and immediately refrigerated, (3) soil samples were transferred to clean aluminum trays and dried at 35 degrees Celcius for 48 hours to produce air-dry soil, (4) air-dry soils were then passed through a number 10 sieve to remove rocks and root fragments, (5) 10 grams of sieved, air-dried soil was added to 10 millileters distilled water in glass jars, (6) capped soil slurry jars were agitated for 60 minutes on a reciprocating shaker, and (7) soil slurry jars were uncapped and left to sit for 30 minutes prior to taking pH readings. Soil pH was measured using a FieldScout SoilStik pH Meter (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield, IL, USA) immersed into soil slurries. The pH meter was calibrated using pH standards 7.0 and 10.0, and three pH readings were taken per soil slurry. Soil pH values thus represent the mean of three measurements per sample.Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014).References:Cartwright, J.

			<purpose>This dataset was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Tennessee Water Science Center (TNWSC) in partnership with the National Park Service staff at Stones River National Battlefield (STRI) for the purpose of characterizing seasonal patterns of soil pH for a subset of limestone cedar glades present within STRI.</purpose>

				<procdesc>An unpublished polygon shapefile of 40 limestone glades within Stones River National Battlefield was acquired (National Park Service, undated). Following preliminary field visits to determine accessibility, 12 of the 40 glades were chosen for study (for details on glade selection methodology see Cartwright, 2014). The ArcGIS Buffer tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a 3-meter buffer around each glade polygon. The ArcGIS Create Random Points tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a point feature class of 120 random sampling locations within and near the 12 glades; 80% of the points were generated within the glade interiors, and 20% of the points were generated within their 3-meter buffers. From these points, 36 were selected for soil data collection and analysis (for details on methodology for selection of soil points see Cartwright, 2014). Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014). For details about tabular attributes included in this data set, see the entity and attributes section of this metadata document.
