			<abstract>This dataset contains data collected within limestone cedar glades at Stones River National Battlefield (STRI) near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This dataset represents data collected at 150 quadrat locations (points) within 12 selected cedar glades and contains quantitative characterizations of the ground surface, measurements of depth to bedrock (soil depth), and calculations of canopy coverage based on digital photography. When combined with the hydrologic and soil chemical and microbiological datasets described in the summary section, this information can be used to evaluate relationships between abiotic stressors (such as extreme hydrologic conditions, extreme temperatures, or thin soils) and soil microbial indicators. This information can also be used to explore the factors governing hydrologic conditions within these cedar glades. Missing values are indicated by the value -99999.Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014).References:Cartwright, J.

			<purpose>This dataset was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Tennessee Water Science Center (TNWSC) in partnership with the National Park Service staff at Stones River National Battlefield (STRI) for the purpose of characterizing a subset of limestone cedar glades present within STRI. This dataset contains data types which were only measured once over the course of a study which lasted from September of 2011 through December of 2013. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other spatial datasets generated by the same project, namely datasets representing monthly hydrologic observations (STRI_Glades_Soil_Water_Content_OD.shp, STRI_Glades_Soil_Water_Content_TDR.shp, and STRI_Glades_Soil_Water_Content_ALL.shp) and monthly analysis of soil samples collected (STRI_Glades_Soil_pH.shp, STRI_Glades_Soil_Nitrate.shp, STRI_Glades_Soil_Organic_Matter.shp, STRI_Glades_Soil_Respiration.shp). The attribute “Point_Code” should be used to join data from this file to data in monthly hydrologic and soil files.</purpose>

				<procdesc>An unpublished polygon shapefile of 40 limestone glades within Stones River National Battlefield was acquired (National Park Service, undated). Following preliminary field visits to determine accessibility, 12 of the 40 glades were chosen for study (for details on glade selection methodology see Cartwright, 2014). The ArcGIS Buffer tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a 3-meter buffer around each glade polygon. The ArcGIS Create Random Points tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a point feature class of 150 random sampling locations within and near the 12 glades; 80% of the points were generated within the glade interiors, and 20% of the points were generated within their 3-meter buffers. Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014). For details about tabular attributes included in this data set, see the entity and attributes section of this metadata document.

					<udom>Percent canopy coverage in the western quadrat, values range from 0 to 100. Null values are coded as -99999. Percent canopy coverage for the western quadrat, based on quantitative analysis of digital photographs taken with a level, north-oriented camera positioned approximately 20 centimeters above the ground surface. Values ranging from 0 to 100 represent the percentage of the western quadrat covered by canopy. A value of zero would indicate no canopy (only sky visible in that quadrat of the photograph) and a value of 100 would represent no sky visible, only canopy. Null values are coded as -99999.</udom>

				<attrdef>Unique glade identification number according to Cofer et al (2008). These glade codes represent the unique glade identification numbers assigned previously by the National Park Service to delineated cedar glades at Stones River National Battlefiled. The glade codes in this field correspond to those which label a map of all delineated cedar glades at this site, which is presented in Figure 1 of Cofer et al (2008).
