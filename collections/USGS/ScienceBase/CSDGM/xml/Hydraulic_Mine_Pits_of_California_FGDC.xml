This dataset was compiled from three sources, Topographically Occurring Mine Symbols (TOMS) database produced by the California Department of Conservation (2001), Yeend W.E., 1974, and on-screen digitizing, using current (2015) satellite imagery, of additional hydraulic mine pits not contained in either of these sources.</abstract><purpose>This dataset of hydraulic mine pits was compiled as part of a regional research study attempting to model fish tissue mercury concentrations for streams in the northern Sierra Nevada mountains of California, by using multiple landscape characteristics as model input.</purpose><supplinf>References Cited:
