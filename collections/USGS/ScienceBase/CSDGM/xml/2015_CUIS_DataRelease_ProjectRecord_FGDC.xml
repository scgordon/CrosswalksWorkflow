    <descript>
      <abstract>This data release contains four data files that were used to evaluate the conditions during which erosion occurred and the magnitude of erosional events. A single shapefile contains shoreline positions for five sites measured during the beginning and end of the project and projected shoreline positions based on the observed erosion rates. There are three .csv files that contain measured erosion pin data, photo-electric erosion pin data, and acoustic energy and water level data.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were collected to evaluate the conditions during which erosion occurred and the magnitude of erosional events at select monitoring stations along the western shore of Cumberland Island.  
These data could be used to evaluate the change in future shorline positions and rates of change.</purpose>
