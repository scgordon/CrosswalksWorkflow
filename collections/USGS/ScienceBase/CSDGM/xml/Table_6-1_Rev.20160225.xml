      <abstract>Statistics of daily water levels recorded at monitoring sites in or near Miami-Dade County, Florida, during the 1974—2009 water years ( a period of 13,149 days). [GW, groundwater; NPS, National Park Service; SFWMD, South Florida Water Management District;  SW, surface water; USGS, U.S. Geological Survey. All data adjusted to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Latitude and longitude are in decimal degrees.]</abstract>

      <attraccr>Statistical analyses and hydrographic comparisons were used to quality assure the compiled data. During this process, apparently erroneous values including spikes, and flat periods were deleted if these values were relatively infrequent. Some sites were rejected, however, because there were data anomalies that could not be reconciled through hydrographic comparison. Apparently, erroneous values that were deleted in the edited data table are highlighted in the raw data table. For more information see - Prinos, S.T., and Dixon, J.F., 2016, Statistical analysis and mapping of water levels in the Biscayne aquifer, water conservation areas, and Everglades National Park, Miami-Dade County, Florida, 2000-2009: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2016–5005.

    <logic>Statistical analyses and hydrographic comparisons were used to quality assure the compiled data.</logic>
    <complete>Water level data from sites that were not tied in to a national vertical datum (i.e. National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929, or North American Vertical Datum of 1988 were not used.  Completeness of record was considered when creating maps and certain statistics.  It was determined that the maximum amount of missing records that would still allow fairly good spatial coverage was 20 percent, therefore during mapping, a sites data would need to be at least 80 percent complete for each of the periods evaluated. In some areas, few or no sites met this criteria; therefore, the statistical analyses of water-level data from sites with less than 80 percent complete record were considered, but to a lesser extent.</complete>
