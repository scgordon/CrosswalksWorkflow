Water levels were measured during this period to ensure that wells had adequate time to recover from previous summer pumping and prior to the start of the 2015 summer pumping season. Groundwater-level data from 178 wells cased completely in and open to the Ozark aquifer are available from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS; data available at http:// waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis). Streams and springs in the study area represent the intersection of the groundwater table with land surface; these features were used in the construction of the potentiometric-surface map. In Arkansas and Missouri, where the Ozark aquifer crops out, altitudes of select gaining stream reaches, compiled from previous reports on gaining and losing streams (data available at http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7W9577Q) and select springs (data available at ftp://msdis.missouri.edu/pub/Inland_Water_Resources/MO_2010_ Springs_shp.zip), were calculated from 10-meter digital elevation data (Knierim and others, 2015; Missouri Department of Natural Resources and others, 2010).  After collecting and processing the data, a potentiometric surface was generated by using the interpolation method TopotoRaster in ArcMap. This tool is specifically designed for the creation of hydrologically correct digital elevation models while imposing constraints that ensure a connected drainage structure and a correct representation of the surface from the provided contour data (Esri, 2011). Once the raster surface was created, 100-ft contours were generated by using Contour (Spatial Analyst), which is a spatial analyst tool (available through ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Toolbox) that creates a linefeature class of contours (isolines) from the raster surface (Esri, 2008). Contours were manually adjusted based on topographical influence, a comparison with the regional map of Imes and Emmett (1994), and data point water-level altitudes to more accurately represent the potentiometric surface.</abstract><purpose>Groundwater-level contours were constructed for a regional potentiometric surface of the Ozark aquifer representing synoptic conditions from November 2014 through January 2015. The potentiometric surface can be used to evaluate groundwater-level changes, provide calibration and simulation targets for the Ozark system regional groundwater flow model, and provide complementary data to the Ozark system groundwater availability project.</purpose><supplinf>The regional potentiometric-surface mapping is part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Groundwater Resources Program initiative (http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/gwrp/activities/regional.html) and the Ozark system groundwater availability project (http://ar.water.usgs.gov/ozarks), which seeks to quantify current groundwater resources, evaluate changes in these resources over time, and provide the information
needed to simulate system response to future human-related and environmental stresses.</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20141101</begdate><begtime>010000</begtime><enddate>20150131</enddate><endtime>010000</endtime></rngdates></timeinfo><current>observed</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-95.013618755</westbc><eastbc>-89.353487145</eastbc><northbc>38.926858038</northbc><southbc>35.631680352</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>Hydrology</themekt><themekey>groundwater</themekey><themekey>groundwater-level measurement</themekey><themekey>water-level altitude</themekey><themekey>potentiometric surface</themekey><themekey>water- level contour</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>Hydrogeologic unit</themekt><themekey>Ozark aquifer</themekey></theme><place><placekt>Geographic Name Information System (GNIS)</placekt><placekey>Arkansas</placekey><placekey>Kansas</placekey><placekey>Missouri</placekey><placekey>Oklahoma</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>There is no guarantee concerning the accuracy of the data.

The regional map does not invalidate previous local-scale observations and efforts, as the scope of this regional study did not include the extensive measurements required to delineate local-scale depressions. The potentiometric surface, however, shows regionally important details such as water-level patterns highlighting the intimate connection between surface water and groundwater across large areas and regional groundwater-flow directions.</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey, Lower Mississippi-Gulf Water Science Center</cntorg><cntper>Anna M Nottmeier</cntper></cntorgp><cntpos>Hydrologist</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>Mailing and Physical</addrtype><address>700 West Research Ctr Blvd</address><city>Fayetteville</city><state>AR</state><postal>72701</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>479-442-4888 x200</cntvoice><cntfax>479-442-4066</cntfax><cntemail>anottmeier@usgs.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac><datacred>USGS Groundwater Resources Program, Brian R.
