      <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Harris‐Galveston Subsidence District, City of Houston, Fort Bend Subsidence District, and Lone Star Groundwater Conservation District has produced this dataset of water‐level altitudes and water‐level changes in the Chicot, Evangeline, and Jasper aquifers in the Houston‐Galveston region, Texas. This dataset shows current‐year (2015-2016) water‐level altitudes for each aquifer, 5‐year (2011‐16) water‐level changes for each aquifer, long‐term (1990‐2016 and 1977‐2016) water‐level changes for the Chicot and Evangeline aquifers, and long‐term (2000‐2016) water‐level change for the Jasper aquifer. For the 1‐year (2015-16) water‐level changes, data were computed as the difference in water‐level altitude at each point (well) for which a water‐level measurement was made in 2015 and 2016. Five‐year (2011‐16) water‐level changes were computed the same as for the 1‐year water-level changes; the difference in water‐level altitude at each point for which a water‐level measurement was made in 2011 and 2016. The water‐level measurements in the dataset are built upon and stored in the National Water Information System: Web Interface, groundwater information, field measurements website located here:
http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7P55KJN&#xD;
This site is a publicly available, searchable, online database of water information.</abstract>
      <purpose>Most of the land-surface subsidence in the Houston-Galveston region, Texas, occurs as a direct result of groundwater withdrawals for municipal supply, commercial and industrial use, and irrigation that depressured and dewatered the Chicot, Evangeline, and Jasper aquifers, thereby causing compaction of the aquifer sediments, mostly in the fine-grained silt and clay layers.This dataset, part of an annual series of reports, was created by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Harris‐Galveston Subsidence District, City of Houston, Fort Bend Subsidence District, Lone Star Groundwater Conservation District, and Brazoria County Groundwater Conservation District, to provide resource managers, public officials, researchers, and the general public with ready access to accurate, impartial, scientific information regarding groundwater‐level changes and altitudes in Harris, Galveston, Fort Bend, Montgomery, Brazoria, Chambers, Grimes, Liberty, San Jacinto, Walker, and Waller Counties, Texas</purpose>
