The model assumes that earthquake rates calculated from several different time windows will remain relatively stationary and can be used to forecast earthquake hazard and damage intensity for the year 2016. This assessment is the first step in developing an operational earthquake forecast for the CEUS, and the analysis could be revised with updated seismicity and model parameters. Consensus input models consider alternative earthquake catalog durations, smoothing parameters, maximum magnitudes, and ground motion estimates, and represent uncertainties in earthquake occurrence and diversity of opinion in the science community.  Near some areas of active induced earthquakes, hazard is higher than in the 2014 USGS National Seismic Hazard Model (NHSM) by more than a factor of 3; the 2014 NHSM did not consider induced earthquakes. In some areas, previously observed induced earthquakes have stopped, so the seismic hazard reverts back to the 2014 NSHM.
This data set represents the results of calculations of hazard curves for a grid of points with a spacing of 0.05 degrees in latitude and longitude.  It represents the chance of experiencing damaging earthquakes for a fixed ground shaking level that corresponds with MMI = VI, based on a peak ground acceleration value of 0.1155 g for site class D.  The data are for the Western United States and are based on the long-term 2014 National Seismic Hazard Model.</abstract><purpose>This map is intended to provide an estimate for the chance of experiencing damage from an earthquake from peak ground acceleration hazard curves.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20160101</begdate><enddate>20161231</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-125.0 degrees</westbc><eastbc>-98.65 degrees</eastbc><northbc>50.0 degrees</northbc><southbc>24.6 degrees</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>none</themekt><themekey>Seismic</themekey><themekey>Earthquake</themekey><themekey>Hazard</themekey><themekey>Induced</themekey><themekey>Natural</themekey></theme><place><placekt>http://geonames.usgs.gov/</placekt><placekey>Arizona</placekey><placekey>California</placekey><placekey>Colorado</placekey><placekey>Idaho</placekey><placekey>Montana</placekey><placekey>Nevada</placekey><placekey>New Mexico</placekey><placekey>Oregon</placekey><placekey>Texas</placekey><placekey>Utah</placekey><placekey>Washington</placekey><placekey>Wyoming</placekey><placekey>USA</placekey><placekey>United States</placekey></place><temporal><tempkt>none</tempkt><tempkey>2016</tempkey></temporal></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>The data are not to be used for areas outside the conterminous United States.

The grid has a cell spacing of 0.05 degrees in both latitude and longitude.   Using log-log interpolation, the hazard curves at each grid point were used to determine the probability of experiencing MMI = VI based on a peak ground acceleration value of 0.1155 g for site class D.  The data were imported into a grid and then contoured using ArcGIS.  The desired final contours were selected and polygon topology was ascertained as well as appropriate feature attributes.</procdesc><procdate>2016</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Vector</direct><ptvctinf><sdtsterm><sdtstype>G-polygon</sdtstype><ptvctcnt>26</ptvctcnt></sdtsterm></ptvctinf></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><planar><mapproj><mapprojn>Albers Conical Equal Area</mapprojn><albers><stdparll>29.5</stdparll><stdparll>45.5</stdparll><longcm>-95.0</longcm><latprjo>0.0</latprjo><feast>0.0</feast><fnorth>0.0</fnorth></albers></mapproj><planci><plance>coordinate pair</plance><coordrep><absres>0.0001</absres><ordres>0.0001</ordres></coordrep><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>D_Clarke_1866</horizdn><ellips>Clarke 1866</ellips><semiaxis>6378206.4</semiaxis><denflat>294.978698</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><detailed><enttyp><enttypl>WUS_ProbDamagePGA.shp</enttypl><enttypd>Areas of chance of damage from an earthquake in 2016 that fall within a specified range</enttypd><enttypds>USGS</enttypds></enttyp><attr><attrlabl>FID</attrlabl><attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef><attrdefs>Esri</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl><attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef><attrdefs>Esri</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>ValueRange</attrlabl><attrdef>The chance of damage from an earthquake in 2016 within a polygon is within range of this value</attrdef><attrdefs>USGS</attrdefs><attrdomv><edom><edomv>&lt; 1</edomv><edomvd>Chance of damage from an earthquake in 2016 is less than 1 percent within this polygon</edomvd><edomvds>USGS</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>1-2</edomv><edomvd>Chance of damage from an earthquake in 2016 within this polygon ranges between 1 and 2 percent</edomvd><edomvds>USGS</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>2-5</edomv><edomvd>Chance of damage from an earthquake in 2016 within this polygon ranges between 2 and 5 percent</edomvd><edomvds>USGS</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>5-10</edomv><edomvd>Chance of damage from an earthquake in 2016 within this polygon ranges between 5 and 10 percent</edomvd><edomvds>USGS</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>10-17</edomv><edomvd>Chance of damage from an earthquake in 2016 within this polygon ranges between 10 and 17 percent</edomvd><edomvds>USGS</edomvds></edom></attrdomv></attr></detailed></eainfo><distinfo><distrib><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey - ScienceBase</cntorg></cntorgp><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>Denver Federal Center, Building 810, Mail Stop 302</address><city>Lakewood</city><state>CO</state><postal>80215</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>1-888-275-8747</cntvoice><cntemail>sciencebase@usgs.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></distrib><resdesc>Downloadable geospatial data sets in shapefile format.</resdesc><distliab>Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.
