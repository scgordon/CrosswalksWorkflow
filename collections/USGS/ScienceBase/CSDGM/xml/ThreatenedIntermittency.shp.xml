      <abstract>Our objective was to model the risk of becoming intermittent under drier climate conditions on small, ungaged streams in the Upper Colorado River Basin. Modeling streamflows is an important tool for understanding landscape-scale drivers of flow and estimating flows where there are no gaged records. We focused our study in the Upper Colorado River Basin, a region that is not only critical for water resources but also projected to experience large future climate shifts toward a drier climate. We used a conditional inference modeling approach to model the relation between intermittency status on gaged streams (115 gages) and selected mean and minimum flow metrics. We then projected intermittency status and if a stream reach would be "threatened by intermittency" under a drier climate to ungaged reaches in the Upper Colorado River Basin using predicted minimum flow coefficient of variation (CV) and specific mean annual flow for each stream reach in the basin. This data layer shows modeled values of stream intermittency based on minimum flow CV and specific mean annual flow for each stream reach in the basin.</abstract>
      <purpose>Projected intermittency status and if a stream reach would be "threatened by intermittency" under a drier climate based on predicted minimum flow CV and specific mean annual flow for small, ungaged streams in the Upper Colorado River Basin. This map projection of intermittency and threatened intermittency are useful for scientists, land owners, and policy makers to understand current hydrology in the Upper Colorado River Basin and to make informed decisions regarding water resources.</purpose>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>We selected 115 streamgages across the Upper Colorado River Basin with at least 8 years of data on small (1st-4th order), unimpacted streams to train the random forest models. We determined mean and minimum flow metrics for each of the 115 study gage records.</procdesc>
        <procdate>2011</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>We used a random forest approach to model the relation between flow metrics at our study gage sites and environmental variables at each site. Environmental variables were derived from geographic data layers of climate (17), soils (2), geology (13), and land cover (7) for each individual raster cell in the Upper Colorado River Basin stream network (Reynolds and others, 2015; table 2). Environmental variables were calculated or accumulated for the upstream watershed of each cell as appropriate. We then rectified our gage site locations with environmental variable raster layers for the random forests.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20120901</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>To fit our random forest models, we used the randomForest function of the statistical software R’s randomForest package. We conducted a model selection process where environmental variables that fell below a calculated model improvement ratio were dropped from the model. We then selected the model that minimized mean square error (MSE) and maximized percentage of variation explained for each flow metric (Reynolds and others, 2015). We assessed model fit with percentage of variation explained (psuedo-R^2), MSE, and a calculated P-value for the best model for each flow metric.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20130501</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>To project flow metrics to ungaged reaches in the Upper Colorado River Basin, we used the environmental variables for each stream raster cell in the basin to predict flow metrics across the stream network. We used the predict function of R’s raster package, which uses the independent (environmental) variable layers and the fitted model to predict each flow metric at each stream raster cell. Because our random forest models where trained on streamgage data from small streams, we filtered out all stream cells in our projection maps with a drainage area greater than 4,000 square kilometers (1,560 square miles), or approximately 5th order and greater streams.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20130930</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>We used a conditional inference tree modeling approach to model intermittency status (perennial, weakly intermittent, strongly intermittent) with mean and minimum streamflow metrics. Minimum flow coefficient of variation (CV) and specific mean annual flow were the best predictors of intermittency status. We used the thresholds determined by the conditional inference tree to show groupings of streams by hydrology based on minimum flow CV and specific mean annual flow. Thresholds of 61.84 percent and 230 percent minimum flow CV and 0.096 specific mean daily flow were important thresholds for differentiating streams (Reynolds and others, 2015). Streams that had between 61.84 percent and 230 percent minimum flow CV and less than 0.096 specific mean daily flow were moderately dry streams, which included a mix of weakly intermittent and perennial streams.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20130930</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>We used the Conditional (Con) tool in the Spatial Analyst tool box to determine all streams with less than 61.84 percent minimum flow CV, which indicates perennial streams. &#xD;
Input raster: MinFlowCV.tif&#xD;
Expression: "Value"&gt;6184; (Because MinFlowCV.tif values are min flow CV *100)&#xD;
Input true raster: MinFlowCV.tif&#xD;
Input false raster or constant value: 100,000&#xD;
Output raster: cv61minCV&#xD;
Therefore, in the resulting raster, 100,000 constant values indicate minumum flow CV &lt; 61.84 percent (perennial streams) and values &lt; 100,000 are MinFlowCV * 100.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20150817</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>We then used the Conditional (Con) tool in the Spatial Analyst tool box to differentiate all streams with greater than 230.32 percent minimum flow CV, which indicates strongly intermittent streams and also output stream cells with minimum flow CV between 61.84 percent and 230.32 percent with their appropriate specific mean annual flow values.&#xD;
Input raster: cv61minCV&#xD;
Expression: "Value"&lt;=23032; (Because MinFlowCV.tif values are min flow CV *100)&#xD;
Input true raster: SpMeanFlow.tif&#xD;
Input false raster or constant value: cv61minCV&#xD;
Output raster: mincv61_230&#xD;
Therefore, in the resulting raster, 100,000 values are minimum flow CV &lt; 61.84 percent (perennial streams), values &lt;100,000 and &gt;23,032 are Min CV * 100 (strongly intermittent streams) and all other values (minimum flow CV values between 61.84 percent and 230.32 percent) are Sp Mean Flow * 1,000 (range: 10-760).</procdesc>
        <procdate>20150817</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>We then converted the raster to a polyline to better represent stream reaches and visualize predicted intermittency status. We used the Raster-To-Polyline tool in the Conversion tool box.&#xD;
Input raster: mincv61_230&#xD;
Field: Value&#xD;
Output polyline features: threatenedintermittency.shp&#xD;
Background value: NoData&#xD;
Therefore, in the resulting polyline, the Grid_Code attribute has the values from the “value” attribute in the input raster: 100,000 values are minimum flow CV &lt; 61.84 percent (perennial streams), values &lt;100,00 and &gt;23,032 are Min CV * 100 (strongly intermittent streams) and all other values (minimum flow CV values between 61.84 percent and 230.32 percent) are Sp Mean Flow * 1,000 (range: 10-760).</procdesc>
        <procdate>20150817</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Last, we added a field to the attribute table called "Pred_Int" as a text field to indicate predicted hydrology/intermittency status under a drier climate. We used the Calculate Field tool with a Visual Basic script in the attribute table to derive the text for "Pred_int" based on the Grid_Code field.&#xD;
Calculate field tool inputs:&#xD;
Input table: threatenedintermittency.shp&#xD;
Field name (new field added): Pred_Int&#xD;
Expression: value&#xD;
Expression type: VB&#xD;
Code block:&#xD;
Dim value&#xD;
If [GRID_CODE] &gt; 63000 Then&#xD;
value = "Perennial: MinCV&lt;=61.84%"&#xD;
elseif [GRID_CODE] &lt;= 96 Then&#xD;
value = "Threat. Intermit.: 61.84%&lt;MinCV&lt;=230.32% and SpMeanFlow &lt;= 0.096"&#xD;
elseif [GRID_CODE] &lt; 761 Then&#xD;

value = "Strongly intermittent: MinCV&gt;230.32%"&#xD;
