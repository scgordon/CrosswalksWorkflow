The model assumes that earthquake rates calculated from several different time windows will remain relatively stationary and can be used to forecast earthquake hazard and damage intensity for the year 2016. This assessment is the first step in developing an operational earthquake forecast for the CEUS, and the analysis could be revised with updated seismicity and model parameters. Consensus input models consider alternative earthquake catalog durations, smoothing parameters, maximum magnitudes, and ground motion estimates, and represent uncertainties in earthquake occurrence and diversity of opinion in the science community.  Near some areas of active induced earthquakes, hazard is higher than in the 2014 USGS National Seismic Hazard Model (NHSM) by more than a factor of 3; the 2014 NHSM did not consider induced earthquakes. In some areas, previously observed induced earthquakes have stopped, so the seismic hazard reverts back to the 2014 NSHM.
This data set represents the results of calculations of hazard curves for a grid of points with a spacing of 0.05 degrees in latitude and longitude.  It represents the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) with a 1-percent probability of exceedance in 1 year.  The MMI values are obtained by converting 1.0-second spectral response acceleration to MMI.  The data are for the Western United States and are based on the long-term 2014 National Seismic Hazard Model.</abstract><purpose>This map is intended to provide an estimate of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) with a 1-percent probability of exceedance in 1 year, from 1.0-second spectral response acceleration.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20160101</begdate><enddate>20161231</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-125.005 degrees</westbc><eastbc>-102.305 degrees</eastbc><northbc>50.02 degrees</northbc><southbc>26.42 degrees</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>none</themekt><themekey>Seismic</themekey><themekey>Earthquake</themekey><themekey>Hazard</themekey><themekey>Induced</themekey><themekey>Natural</themekey></theme><place><placekt>http://geonames.usgs.gov/</placekt><placekey>Arizona</placekey><placekey>California</placekey><placekey>Colorado</placekey><placekey>Idaho</placekey><placekey>Montana</placekey><placekey>Nevada</placekey><placekey>New Mexico</placekey><placekey>Oregon</placekey><placekey>Texas</placekey><placekey>Utah</placekey><placekey>Washington</placekey><placekey>Wyoming</placekey><placekey>USA</placekey><placekey>United States</placekey></place><temporal><tempkt>none</tempkt><tempkey>2016</tempkey></temporal></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>The data are not to be used for areas outside the conterminous United States.

The grid has a cell spacing of 0.05 degrees in both latitude and longitude.   Using log-log interpolation, the hazard curves at each grid point were used to determine ground motions that have a 1-percent probability of being exceeded in 1 year for 1.0-second spectral response acceleration.  Using the topographic-based soil classification methods of Wald and Allen (2007), the calculated ground motions were amplified for soil type based on the amplification factors of Stewart and Seyhan (2013).  Finally, the amplified ground motions for 1.0-second response acceleration were converted to Modified Mercalli Intensities to obtain the final data set.</procdesc><procdate>2016</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Raster</direct><rastinfo><rasttype>Pixel</rasttype><rowcount>472</rowcount><colcount>454</colcount></rastinfo></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><geograph><latres>0.000000001</latres><longres>0.000000001</longres><geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit></geograph><geodetic><horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn><ellips>World Geodetic System 1984</ellips><semiaxis>6378137</semiaxis><denflat>298.257223563</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><detailed><enttyp><enttypl>WUS_1PctIn1YrPGAMMI_WithSoils.tif</enttypl><enttypd>Modified Mercalli Intensity based on horizontal spectral response acceleration for 1.0-second period, with 1-percent probability of exceedance in 1 year</enttypd><enttypds>USGS</enttypds></enttyp></detailed><overview><eaover>Each pixel contains a decimal Modified Mercalli Intensity value that has a 1-percent probability of exceedance in one year.
