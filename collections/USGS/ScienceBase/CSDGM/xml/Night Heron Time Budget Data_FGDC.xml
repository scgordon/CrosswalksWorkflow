      <abstract>Parental incubation behavior largely influences nest survival, a critical demographic process in avian population dynamics, and behaviors vary across species with different life history breeding strategies. Although research has identified nest survival advantages of mixing colonies, behavioral mechanisms that might explain these effects is largely lacking. We examined parental incubation behavior using video-monitoring techniques on Alcatraz Island, California, of black-crowned night-heron Nycticorax nycticorax (hereinafter, night-heron) in a mixed-species colony with California gulls Larus californicus and western gulls L. occidentalis. We first quantified general nesting behaviors, incubation constancy, and nest attendance, and a suite of specific nesting behaviors (i.e. inactivity, vigilance, preening, and nest maintenance) with respect to six different daily time periods. We employed linear mixed effects models to investigate environmental and temporal factors as sources of variation in incubation constancy and nest attendance using 211 nest days across three nesting seasons (2010–2012). We found incubation constancy (percent of time on the eggs) and nest attendance (percent of time at the nest) were lower for nests that were located &lt; 3 m from one or more gull nest, which indirectly supports the predator protection hypothesis, whereby heterospecifics provide protection allowing more time for foraging and other self-maintenance activities. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence of the influence of one nesting species on the incubation behavior of another. We also identified distinct differences between incubation constancy and nest attentiveness, indicating that these biparental incubating species do not share similar energetic constraints as those that are observed for uniparental species. Additionally, we found that variation in incubation behavior was a function of temperature and precipitation, where the strength of these effects was dependent on the time of day. Overall, these findings strengthen our understanding of incubation behavior and nest ecology of a colonial-nesting species. This dataset includes variables associated with nesting gulls (VICIN and GULL10).</abstract>
      <purpose>The principle objective of this study was to explain variation in incubation behavior of night-herons by investigating effects of heterospecifics, climatic conditions, within-season temporal effects, and other ecological factors.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Study area
Alcatraz Island (37.8°N, 122.4°W) is a 9.1 ha island located in the San Francisco Bay, approximately 1.6 km north of San Francisco, California, and has been managed by the National Park Service since 1973. The island provides important breeding habitat for many avian species within the San Francisco Bay area (Howell and Pollak 1991, Kelly et al. 1993, Saenz et al. 2006). Night-herons were first documented on the island in 1975 (Bradley 2005) and other species that occupy the island include common ravens Corvus corax, western gulls, and California gulls. Historic buildings, roads, remnants of demolished buildings, as well as vegetation such as century plant Agave americana, mirror plant Coprosma repens, rose Rosa spp., fuchsia Fushia spp., English ivy Hedera helix, ice plant Carpobrotus spp., eucalyptus Eucalyptus spp., and cypress Cupressus macrocarpa characterize the island. Breeding season temperatures average from 4–16°C in the beginning of March to 12–20°C in July. The majority of annual precipitation occurs from January to March, ranging from approximately 9 cm in early breeding season (i.e. March) to &lt; 0.5 cm later in the breeding season (i.e. June and July).
Field methods
We conducted intensive island-wide searches on a weekly basis from mid-April through late July of 2010  2012, during which we sought to locate night-heron nests in the early stages of incubation (i.e. &lt; 7 d elapsed from first egg laid). At each nest, we recorded coordinates of all nests using a hand-held Global Positioning System (UTM, North American Datum 1983), as well as the dominant nesting substrate, which consisted of the six categories: 
blackberry Rubus spp., fuchsia, English ivy, karo Pittosporum crassifolium, century plant, and rubble piles of demolished buildings (i.e. scrap metal, wood reinforcing rods, and other debris).
We installed video systems on a random sample of night-heron nests stratified by dominant vegetation types. We monitored nests continuously (24-h d–1) using microcameras consisting of seven infrared (950 nm wavelength) light-emitting diodes (30 x 110 mm with a 3.6-mm lens; EZ Spy Cam, Los Angeles, CA) and Digital Video Recorders (DVRs). Cameras were concealed using camouflage duct tape and vegetation, and were installed on sturdy vegetation or on a camouflaged iron stake 0.5 – 1.0 m from the selected nest. We used 100 m coaxial cables to connect cameras to 4-channel H.264 DVRs (AV Tech, Hong Kong, China). Each DVR system was camouflaged. Nests with cameras were monitored weekly to confirm nest fates.
During the weeks of 7 June and 14 June in 2011, and 7 May in 2012, we recorded precise locations of every California and western gull nest on the island on high-resolution paper topographic maps to investigate the effects of mixed colony nesting on night-heron incubation behavior. Gull nesting data were not collected in 2010 because of timing constraints.</supplinf>
