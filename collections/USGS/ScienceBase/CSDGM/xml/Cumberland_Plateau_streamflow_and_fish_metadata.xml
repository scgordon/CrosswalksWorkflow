      <abstract>
This geospatial dataset includes one point feature class file and associated FGDC-compliant metadata representing datasets to support development of ecological limit functions for the Cumberland Plateau in northeastern Middle Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky. Knight and others (2012, 2014) developed a methodology of relating fish species richness to changes in hydrologic conditions for sites within the Tennessee River Basin; this dataset applies this methodology to 138 sites within the the Cumberland Plateau. Information contained within this dataset represents values of basin characteristics (see Table II in Knight and others, 2012), estimates of streamflow characteristics (see Table I in Knight and others, 2012), measures of individual and cumulative departure of streamflow characteristics from reference hydrologic conditions, and fish species richness for 138 sites in the study area.   Characteristics describing each basin were estimated and standardized (see Table III in Knight and others, 2012) and include: percent forest, percent agriculture, percent of basin in the Interior Plateau Level 3 Ecoregion, percent of basin in Blue Ridge Level 3 Ecoregion, mean basin elevation, index of Hortonian overland flow, soil factor, geologic factor, monthly mean precipitation, January precipitation deviation, August temperature deviation, temperature range, and rock depth as well as the interaction of soil factor, geologic factor, and rock depth with monthly mean precipitation. Basin characteristics were used as independent variables to estimate streamflow characteristics, also in standardized form, following Knight and others (2012). Estimated streamflow characteristics include measures of the magnitude, duration, frequency, timing, and rate of change of the annual hydrograph (Knight and others, 2012). Departure values for individual streamflow characteristics were determined by calculating the numerical distance (difference) outside the reference range for each streamflow characteristic.  Reference hydrologic conditions for the study area were determined using methods presented in Knight and others (2012; 2014). Reference ranges are included in the metadata in the entity and attribute descriptions for the fields representing individual hydrologic departure values. Cumulative hydrologic departures represent the sum of individual departure values that were identified as statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) in quantile regression analysis based on Knight and others (2014), stratified by fish group. Fish species richness  for 11 fish groups is presented for each site and represents trophic, taxonomic, reproductive, and habitat preferences (see Table I in Knight and others, 2014) as well as fishes that are considered as rare, threatened, or endangered by Withers (2009).

        <srccontr>Source data for calculation of the basin characteristic soil factor.

        <procdesc>Latitude and longitude coordinates for sites associated with data collection of fish species diversity were obtained (see source input metadata) and compiled. Site locations were imported as a vector point file based on these coordinates.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>To prepare for the computation of basin characteristics, elevation data and elevation derivatives created for the Tennessee StreamStats web application (http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/tennessee.html) were compiled for use in this study. For the Tennessee StreamStats application, elevation data from the 1/3 arc-second National Elevation Dataset (10-m NED) were preprocessed with hydrography data and watershed boundaries to create hydrologically-corrected digital elevation models using a custom Arc Macro Language (aml) script containing preprocessing methods similar to those described by Djokic (2008). The sources of the hydrography data used to preprocess the elevation data were the high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and unpublished data from the Tennessee State Base Mapping Program (TNBMP hydrography). Watershed boundaries used to preprocess the elevation data were from Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD), which was considered a draft version at the time of processing. More information about the sources used for this process step can be found in the data source section of this metadata document.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Basins were delineated using Arc Hydro Tools for ArcGIS. Fish site locations were manually aligned with a flow-accumulation-based synthetic stream network developed for the Tennessee StreamStats web application (http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/tennessee.html). The edited site locations were used as pour points for basin delineation. These basins (vector polygons) were used for subsequent computation of basin characteristics.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>PRISM temperature and precipiation data were downloaded and used to calculate climate-related basin characteristics (MonMnPrec, JanPrecDev, DayTempRng, AugTempDev). Input basins were converted to a raster with the same properties (spatial reference, cell size, origin) as the climate raster. Arc Hydro Tools for ArcGIS was used to calculate the mean value of the climate raster for each basin. Derivative values (such as temperature-deviation characteristics) were manually calculated after the annual/monthly normal values were derived from raster analysis.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD2001) was downloaded and used to calculate basin characteristics (AgPct, ForestPct). Input basins were converted to a raster with the same properties (spatial reference, cell size, origin) as the land-use raster. In order to calculate land-use type (such as agricultural or forest) percentages, land-use subtypes were grouped to an appropriate category. Subtypes 52 (shrub/Scrub), 71 (grassland/herbaceous), 81 (pasture/hay), and 82 (cultivated crops) were combined to create an agricultural raster (see derived_data folder) in which agricultural types = 1 and all other types = 0. Using the same techniques, a forest grid (see derived_data folder) was created by combining subtypes 41 (deciduous forest), 42 (evergreeen forest), and 43 (mixed forest). Percentages of agricultural and forest land-use types were calculated using Arc Hydro Tools for ArcGIS.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The 1/3 arc-second National Elevation Dataset (10-m NED) was downloaded for each 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) in the study area. The elevation data for each HUC were projected to TN StatePlane NAD83 (US feet), resampled to a cell size of 30x30 feet, multiplied to convert elevation units to 100ths of feet, and merged to create a single elevation grid for the study area. Input basins were converted to a raster with the same properties (spatial reference, cell size, origin) as the elevation raster. Arc Hydro Tools for ArcGIS were used to calculate the mean value of the elevation raster (the ElevFt field) for each basin.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A raster representing the estimated long-term average percentage of infiltration-excess overland flow (Hortonian flow) was downloaded (see source input metadata), clipped to the study area, projected to TN StatePlane NAD83 (US feet), and resampled to a cell size of 30 x 30 feet. Input basins were converted to a raster with the same properties (spatial reference, cell size, origin) as the Hortonian-flow raster. Arc Hydro Tools for ArcGIS were used to calculate the mean Hortonian-flow value for each basin.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A polygon coverage and accompanying information table representing rock depth from the Conterminous United States Multi-Layer Soil Characteristics Data Set for Regional Climate and Hydrology Modeling were downloaded. The rock depth information from the information table was joined to the coverage. The data were clipped to the study area, projected to TN StatePlane NAD83 (US feet), and converted to a grid with a cell size of 30 x 30 feet. Input basins were converted to a raster with the same properties (spatial reference, cell size, origin) as the rock-depth raster. Arc Hydro Tools for ArcGIS were used to calculate the mean depth to rock for each basin (RockDepth).</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Using basin characteristics (see previous processing steps) as independent variables, streamflow characteristics (MA41, LRA7, E85, AMH10, LDH13, ML20, TA1, LFH7, FH6, LML18, LDL6, MA26, and TL1) were estimated for each site according to Knight and others (2012). See entity and attribute metadata and references therein for detailed descriptions of methodology used to estimate streamflow characteristics based on regional predictive equations with basin characteristics as independent variables.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>For each site, departure values for individual streamflow characteristics (Dep_MA41, Dep_LRA7, Dep_E85, Dep_AMH10, Dep_LDH13, Dep_ML20, Dep_TA1, Dep_LFH7, Dep_FH6, Dep_LML18, Dep_LDL6, Dep_MA26, and Dep_TL1) were determined by calculating the numerical distance (difference) outside the reference range for each streamflow characteristic.  Reference hydrologic conditions for the study area were determined using methods presented in Knight and others (2012; 2014). Reference ranges are included in the entity and attribute descriptions for the fields representing individual hydrologic departure values. See entity and attribute metadata and references therein for detailed descriptions of methodology for calculating departure from hydrologic reference conditions.</procdesc>
        <procdate>2010</procdate>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>For each site, cumulative hydrologic departure (CHD) variables (CHD_Headw, CHD_Intol, CHD_Native, CHD_Invert, CHD_Spec_in, CHD_TopPrd, CHD_LithSp, CHD_PoolDw, CHD_RiffDw, CHD_All_Sp, and CHD_RTE_Sp) were calculated as the sum of individual hydrologic departure values for the streamflow characteristics that had significant (P&lt;0.05) 85th, 90th, or 95th regression quantiles based on quantile regression relating the departures of individual streamflow characteristics to species richness, stratified by fish group. For each CHD variable, the individual streamflow characteristics that were used to calculate the cumulative hydrologic departure values are listed in the entity and attribute description. See entity and attribute metadata and references therein for detailed descriptions of methodology for calculating cumulative hydrologic departure.</procdesc>

The entity and attribute information provided here describes datasets to support development of ecological limit functions for the Cumberland Plateau in northeastern Middle Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky. The datasets contain values of basin characteristics, estimates of streamflow characteristics, measures of individual and cumulative departure of streamflow characteristics from reference hydrologic conditions, and fish species richness for 138 sites in the study area.
The basin characteristics describe climate, physical landscape features, regional indicators, and land use. These basin characteristics were used to estimate streamflow characteristics based on regional predictive equations according to Knight and others (2012). The basin characteristics are: AgPct, ForestPct, IntPlatPct, BlueRdgPct, ElevFt, Horton, SoilFactor, G_Factor, MonMnPrec, JanPrecDev, DayTempRng, AugTempDev, RockDepth, SoilFac_in, RockDep_in, and G_Fact_in. A brief definition for each basin characteristic is provided in the entity and attribute description. Please see Knight and others (2012) for detailed descriptions of all basin characteristics and of methodology used to estimate streamflow characteristics based on regional predictive equations using these basin characteristics as independent variables.
The estimates of streamflow characteristics include measures of the magnitude, duration, frequency, timing, and rate of change of the annual hydrograph. These estimates were calculated according to Knight and others (2012) using regional predictive equations with basin characteristics as independent variables. The estimates of streamflow characteristics are: MA41, LRA7, E85, AMH10, LDH13, ML20, TA1, LFH7, FH6, LML18, LDL6, MA26, and TL1. A brief definition for each streamflow characteristic is provided in the entity and attribute description. Please see Knight and others (2012) for detailed descriptions of all streamflow characteristics and of methodology used to estimate streamflow characteristics based on regional predictive equations with basin characteristics as independent variables.
Departure values for individual streamflow characteristics were determined by calculating the numerical distance (difference) outside the reference range for each streamflow characteristic.  Reference hydrologic conditions for the study area were determined using methods presented in Knight and others (2012; 2014). Reference ranges are included in the entity and attribute descriptions for the fields representing individual hydrologic departure values. These individual hydrologic departure values are: Dep_MA41, Dep_LRA7, Dep_E85, Dep_AMH10, Dep_LDH13, Dep_ML20, Dep_TA1, Dep_LFH7, Dep_FH6, Dep_LML18, Dep_LDL6, Dep_MA26, and Dep_TL1. See Knight and others (2014) for detailed descriptions of methodology for calculating departure from hydrologic reference conditions.
Cumulative departure of streamflow characteristics from reference hydrologic conditions is equal to the sum of individual hydrologic departure values for the streamflow characteristics that had significant (P&lt;0.05) 85th, 90th, or 95th regression quantiles based on quantile regression relating the departures of individual streamflow characteristics to species richness, stratified by fish group. The cumulative hydrologic departure (CHD) variables are: CHD_Headw, CHD_Intol, CHD_Native, CHD_Invert, CHD_Spec_in, CHD_TopPrd, CHD_LithSp, CHD_PoolDw, CHD_RiffDw, CHD_All_Sp, and CHD_RTE_Sp. For each CHD variable, the individual streamflow characteristics that were used to calculate the cumulative hydrologic departure values are listed in the entity and attribute description. See Knight and others (2014) for detailed descriptions of methodology for calculating cumulative hydrologic departure.
Fish species richness (counts) are presented for each fish group. The fish groups are: Head_intol, Intolerant, Native, Invertivor, Spec_insec, Top_pred, Lith_spawn, Pool_dwl, Riffle_dwl, All_spcs, and RTE_spcs. A brief definition for each fish group is provided in the entity and attribute description. See Knight and others (2014) for detailed descriptions of fish groups based on trophic, habitat, and tolerance characteristics. See Withers (2009) for lists of fish species that are considered rare, threatened, or endangered (RTE).
