			<abstract>This dataset contains data collected within limestone cedar glades at Stones River National Battlefield (STRI) near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This dataset contains measurements of volumetric soil water content at certain quadrat locations (points) within 12 selected cedar glades. All soil water content measurements in this file were performed by thermogravimetric analysis (oven-drying) using the following procedure. First, soil samples were obtained using a brass cylinder of height 5 centimeters (cm) and interior diameter 4.9 cm. The cylinder was partially inserted into the soil, using a hammer if necessary, to a depth of roughly 2 to 3 cm. Soil adjacent to the inserted cylinder was removed and a flat plastic spatula was inserted under the cylinder, allowing an intact core to be removed. The soil core, still in the cylinder, was placed inside an aluminum canister (height 2.5 cm, interior diameter 6.3 cm) and four depth measurements were taken from the upper rim of the cylinder to the soil surface. These four measurements were used to calculate the volume of the soil core. All the soil in the interior of the cylinder was then scraped into the canister and the canister was immediately sealed with a tight-fitting screw-top lid. Oven drying was performed according to Topp (1993) and Topp and Ferre (2002), using a Binder ED-23 drying oven set to 105 degrees Celcius (degrees C) for 24 hours. Gravimetric soil water content calculations (field-moist weight minus oven-dry weight, divided by oven-dry weight) were then converted to volumetric equivalents using bulk density calculations based on volume estimations of soil cores (volumetric soil water content equals gravimetric soil water content times bulk density). Three soil samples were obtained per point for thermogravimetric analysis, and the values in the fields of this dataset represent means of those three measurements. Missing values indicate points which were not sampled on a given day, or points for which the method of soil water content determination was not thermogravimetric, and are represented by the value -99999. Please note that this dataset can be used in conjunction with two associated datasets: STRI_Glades_Soil_Water_Content_TDR.shp, which contains soil water content measurements obtained using a portable time-domain reflectometery moisture meter, and STRI_Glades_Soil_Water_Content_ALL.shp, which contains soil-water-content measurements obtained by both time-domain reflectometery and oven-drying methods wherein time-domain reflectometery measurements have been transformed to oven-drying-method equivalents using a calibration curve. For details on this calibration procedure to compare soil water content measurements obtained by the two methods, see the metadata section for the file STRI_Glades_Soil_Water_Content_ALL.shp.Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014).References:Cartwright, J.

				<procdesc>An unpublished polygon shapefile of 40 limestone glades within Stones River National Battlefield was acquired (National Park Service, undated). Following preliminary field visits to determine accessibility, 12 of the 40 glades were chosen for study (for details on glade selection methodology see Cartwright, 2014). The ArcGIS Buffer tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a 3-meter buffer around each glade polygon. The ArcGIS Create Random Points tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a point feature class of 120 random sampling locations within and near the 12 glades; 80% of the points were generated within the glade interiors, and 20% of the points were generated within their 3-meter buffers. Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014). For details about tabular attributes included in this data set, see the entity and attributes section of this metadata document.

				<attrdef>Volumetric soil water content at certain quadrat locations (points) as measured on January 21, 2012 by thermogravimetric analysis (oven-drying). For details on the procedure used for calculating volumetric soil water content by this method, see the description paragraph for this dataset. Missing values are indicated by the value -99999. Three soil samples were obtained per point for thermogravimetric analysis, and the values in this field represent the mean of those three measurements.</attrdef>
