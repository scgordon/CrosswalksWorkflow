      	To accurately estimate agricultural water use or to project future water demands, a detailed inventory of current irrigated crop acreage is needed at a high level of resolution. In many Florida counties this kind of detailed high-resolution inventory is not available. A detailed digital map and summary of irrigated acreage during the 2015 growing season was developed for 13 of the 15 counties that compose the Suwannee River Water Management District. The irrigated areas were delineated using land-use data, orthoimagery, water management district consumptive water-use permits, and digitized agricultural landuse maps developed by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Florida Statewide Agricultural Irrigation Demand geodatabase. These areas were then field-verified between May and November of 2015 and summarized. Selected attribute data were collected for the irrigated areas, including crop type, primary water source, and type of irrigation system.

      <attraccr>The field verification was conducted beginning in early May 2015 and concluded March 2016. Each field with an irrigation system or a withdrawal permit was observed from the road at least once during the study period. Upon completion of the field verification, a draft map was produced. This draft map was reviewed by the SRWMD to help identify any missing fields, and a final verified map was produced for publication (Appendix 1). After changes were made and questions resolved, the results of the all field verified data were totaled and summarized to produce this report.   For additional information see Marella, R.L., Dixon, J.F., and Berry, D.R., 2016, Agricultural Irrigated Land-Use Inventory for the counties in the Suwannee River Water Management District, 2015: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2016–1111, xx p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20161111</attraccr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A preliminary map showing agricultural land and acreage by crop type was developed using land-use data collected for 2013-2014 or was obtained from outside sources. Obvious and potential irrigation fields on the preliminary map were digitized using more recent orthoimages from 2014 and 2015 to produce an adjusted map that was to be used for field verification. Once the field verification was completed and changes were made on the adjusted map (and corresponding shape files), a final field-verified map was produced. All data and results presented in this report are compiled from the final field-verified map.&#xD;
The preliminary maps for all 13 counties were developed from data obtained from the GIS layers digitized by FDACS as part of the Florida Statewide Agricultural Irrigation Demand (FSAID) geodatabase (Daniel Dourte, The Balmoral Group, written commun., March 3, and October 14, 2015). The FSAID maps provided a spatial representation of the location of potential irrigated fields. These fields were then digitized using the most recent orthoimages and an adjusted field map was created. Fields with irrigation equipment visible from the orthoimages were added to the adjusted field map. Orthoimages are a composite of high resolution aerial images (obtained from either an aircraft or a satellite) that combine the visual attributes of an aerial photograph with the spatial accuracy and reliability of a planimetric map (http://nationalmap.gov/ortho.html). Orthoimages obtained from the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center (https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/high_res_ortho) primarily represent images from 2012 and 2013 for the counties within the SRWMD. Google Earth images from January and February of 2013, 2014, and 2015 were also used during digitizing. Another source used for reference were the World Imagery base map from ESRI ArcGIS online.&#xD;
(http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9). Questions or concerns about several of the digitized field shapes or locations on the adjusted map were answered during field verification or resolved during conversations with local experts.&#xD;
Also added to the adjusted map was a point layer of the current agricultural irrigation consumptive water-use (CUP) permits for the SRWMD along with a shape file with each permits property boundary (Glenn Horvath, SRWMD, written commun., May 11, 2015). These locations of CUP (wells or surface-water intakes) as well as the property boundaries helped identify fields that were new or may not have been seen on the FSAID maps or othoimages. For the part of Jefferson and Levy counties not in the SRWMD, the FSAID maps and orthoimages were also used along CUP locations obtained from the NWFWMD (Ken Friedman, NWFWMD, written commun., July 28, 2015) and the SWFWMD (http://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/data/gis/layer_library/category/regulatory).  Groundwater was assigned as the default water source for fields where a water source could not be verified through a CUP or a visual observation. These assumptions and other limitations were documented in the attribute files.
