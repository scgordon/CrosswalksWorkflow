			<abstract>This dataset contains data collected within limestone cedar glades at Stones River National Battlefield (STRI) near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This dataset contains measurements of soil respiration at certain quadrat locations (points) within 12 selected cedar glades. Field measurements were made of soil respiration (carbon dioxide efflux) using a LICOR Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA), LI-6400 XT portable photosynthesis device (LICOR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), fitted with a soil-chamber attachment. At least 48 hours prior to soil respiration measurement, three soil collars (plastic rings of approximately 2 inches depth) were inserted into the soil surface at each point and the height of each soil collar above the soil surface was measured. Soil respiration measurements were made using a threshold set point based on ambient carbon dioxide concentration at the time of measurement, and two measurement cycles were completed at each soil collar, yielding six total respiration measurements per point. Soil respiration measurements are expressed as carbon dioxide efflux in micromoles per square meter per second and represent the mean of the six measurements per quadrat location.Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014).References:Cartwright, J.

			<purpose>This dataset was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Tennessee Water Science Center (TNWSC) in partnership with the National Park Service staff at Stones River National Battlefield (STRI) for the purpose of characterizing seasonal patterns of soil respiration for a subset of limestone cedar glades present within STRI.</purpose>

				<procdesc>An unpublished polygon shapefile of 40 limestone glades within Stones River National Battlefield was acquired (National Park Service, undated). Following preliminary field visits to determine accessibility, 12 of the 40 glades were chosen for study (for details on glade selection methodology see Cartwright, 2014). The ArcGIS Buffer tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a 3-meter buffer around each glade polygon. The ArcGIS Create Random Points tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a point feature class of 120 random sampling locations within and near the 12 glades; 80% of the points were generated within the glade interiors, and 20% of the points were generated within their 3-meter buffers. From these points, 36 were selected for soil data collection and analysis (for details on methodology for selection of soil points see Cartwright, 2014). Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014). For details about tabular attributes included in this data set, see the entity and attributes section of this metadata document.
