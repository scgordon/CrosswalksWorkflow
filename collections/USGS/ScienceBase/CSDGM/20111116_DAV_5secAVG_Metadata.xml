      <abstract>These data were collected using a 600 kHz TRDI Rio Grande acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) in mode 12 with 50 centimeter bins from a moving boat.  The data were georeferenced with a Hemisphere Crescent A100 differential Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with submeter accuracy.  The data have been depth-averaged over the entire measured portion of the water column and temporally averaged over 5-second intervals to reduce noise.  These data were collected during dye tracing surveys of the right bank of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and include low-velocity regions of the canal such as barge slips in addition to the main channel. Data were processed using the Velocity Mapping Toolbox (Parsons and others, 2013). NOTE: Any data assigned a value of "-9999" are bad or missing data and should not be used for analysis.

      <purpose>These data were collected to accompany dye tracing surveys of the lower Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal targeting identification of potential inflows of Des Plaines River water through the fractured bedrock that separates the two water bodies.</purpose>
