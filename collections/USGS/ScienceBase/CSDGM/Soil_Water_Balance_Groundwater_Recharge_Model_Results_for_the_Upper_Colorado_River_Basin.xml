      <abstract>This USGS Data Release represents Soil-Water Balance (SWB) groundwater recharge modeling results for the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). The data release was produced in compliance with 'open data' requirements as way to make the scientific products associated with USGS research efforts and publications available to the public.&#xD;
There are 3 separate datasets associated with this Data Release:&#xD;
1. SWB model results from simulations run using observed climate data, summarized by water year from 1951 through 2010&#xD;
2. SWB model results from simulations run using projected climate data, summarized by month and UCRB sub-basin from 1950 through 2099&#xD;
3. SWB model results from simulations run using projected climate data, summarized by water year from 1951 through 2099</abstract>
      <purpose>Groundwater recharge in the Upper Colorado River Basin was simulated in order to better understand potential changes in the groundwater system in response to projected climate change.</purpose>
