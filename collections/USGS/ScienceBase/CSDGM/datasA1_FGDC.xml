      <abstract>Using nest records and locations to identify landscape-scale parameters (distance to coast, elevation, slope, and land cover) that provide potential nesting habitat, we produced a final map classifying 12% (70,411 km2) of the lands assessed as potential Kittlitz’s Murrelet nesting habitat with dense but distinct patches located in northern Alaska and a more uninterrupted, narrow band extended across coastal mountainous areas in the Pacific Coastal Mountains, Alaska Peninsula Mountains, and Aleutian Islands. The regional variation in habitat-capable parameter values indicate the Kittlitz’s Murrelet may be able to use a variety of habitats for nesting depending on availability. Future nesting habitat studies that employ spatially random sampling designs will allow for more quantitatively robust modeling of nesting habitat and allow predictive extrapolation to areas where nests have not been located, but likely exist.</abstract>
      <purpose>This map provides a raster representation of potential Kittlitz's Murrelet (Brachyramphus brevirostris) nesting habitat in Alaska and nearshore Canada.</purpose>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>This raster was generated from four relevant rasters representing various habitat parameters. 
Elevation: The National Elevation Dataset (NED, 60 meter resolution; USGS 2012) provides the most complete coverage of the state of Alaska at the finest resolution and was thus chosen to represent elevation in AK.  The NED contains some coverage of Canada that is within 100km of the Alaskan coastline; these portions were retained and the remaining gaps were filled using Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED, 25 meter resolution; Centre for Topographic Information 2000). Several small coverage gaps exist within the NED in AK (the Aleutian Islands west of Amchitka Pass, portions of St Lawrence Island, the northernmost Islands of Four Mountains in the Aleutian Islands, Cape Newenham near Goodnews Bay, Rocky Point in Norton Sound, and an area near Port Heiden on the Alaska Peninsula); Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer DEM data (ASTER, 30 meter resolution; NASA 2011) was used to complete DEM coverage in these locations.  The CDED and ASTER DEM rasters were resampled (bilinear) to the NED (coarsest resolution, 60m) and mosaicked into a new raster representing elevation for the entire study area. The raster was then clipped regionally and cells reclassified as 0 (not habitat capable), 1 (habitat capable), or NoData (not considered) based on the classification scheme described in the manuscript. 
Slope: Slope was derived from this mosaicked DEM. The raster was then clipped regionally and cells reclassified as 0 (not habitat capable), 1 (habitat capable), or NoData (not considered) based on the classification scheme described in the manuscript.
Distance to Coastline: A raster representation of the planar distance of terrestrial lands from the coastline was generated at 60m resolution within the study area. The raster was then clipped regionally and cells reclassified as 0 (not habitat capable), 1 (habitat capable), or NoData (not considered) based on the classification scheme described in the manuscript.
Land Cover: In Alaska, the U.S. Geological Survey National Land Cover Database (NLCD, 30m resolution; USGS 2001) was used to represent land cover. This product exists statewide with no gaps. The Earth Observation for the Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD, 25m resolution; Canadian Forest Service 2012) land cover classification was chosen to represent land cover in Canada.  Although both products use Landsat imagery to approximate land cover ca. 2001, the EOSD dataset land classification scheme differs slightly from the NLCD.  However, the EOSD dataset includes classified land in portions of southeast AK adjacent to Canada and a comparison was made to choose the best method for reclassification of the EOSD dataset to be consistent with the NLCD.  Three thousand random points were generated in the area of overlap and land cover classifications were compared between the two products. It was found that EOSD represented the distinction between vegetated and non-vegetated land (barren land and snow/ice) well, but specific vegetated land cover classes did not match consistently. Of the vegetated land classes in the NLCD, we were primarily concerned with delineating the dwarf shrub land cover class because prior knowledge suggests that, after barren land, this vegetation type may be important KIMU nesting habitat (Day et al. 2011).  This land class had to be left unrepresented in Canada; however, the dwarf shrub class accounts for &lt;~2.5% of all land in southeast AK and its absence in Canada should not significantly affect the outcome of our final product. The EOSD also has small coverage gaps due to clouds/shadows that are represented as “No Data” in the final land cover product. The NLCD and EOSD were mosaicked into a new land cover raster, which was then resampled (nearest neighbor) to 60m. The raster was then clipped regionally and cells reclassified as 0 (not habitat capable), 1 (habitat capable), or NoData (not considered) based on the classification scheme described in the manuscript.
The final raster of potential nesting habitat represented herein was produced by multiplying all four habitat parameter rasters and mosaicking the outputs.</procdesc>
