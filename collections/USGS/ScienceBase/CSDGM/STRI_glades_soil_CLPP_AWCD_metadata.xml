			<abstract>This dataset contains data collected within limestone cedar glades at Stones River National Battlefield (STRI) near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This dataset contains information on soil microbial metabolic response for soil samples obtained from certain quadrat locations (points) within 12 selected cedar glades. This information derives from substrate utilization profiles based on Biolog EcoPlates (Biolog, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) which were inoculated with soil slurries containing the entire microbial community present in each soil sample. EcoPlates contain 31 sole-carbon substrates (present in triplicate on each plate) and one blank (control) well. Once the microbial community from a soil sample is inoculated onto the plates, the plates are incubated and absorbance readings are taken at intervals.For each quadrat location (point), one soil sample was obtained under sterile conditions, using a trowel wiped with methanol and rinsed with distilled water, and was placed into an autoclaved jar with a tight-fitting lid and placed on ice. Soil samples were transported to lab facilities on ice and immediately refrigerated. Within 24 hours after being removed from the field, soil samples were processed for community level physiological profiling (CLPP) using Biolog EcoPlates. First, for each soil sample three measurements were taken of gravimetric soil water content using a Mettler Toledo HB43 halogen moisture analyzer (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) and the mean of these three SWC measurements was used to calculate the 10-gram dry weight equivalent (DWE) for each soil sample. For each soil sample, a 10-gram DWE of fresh soil was added to 90 milliliters of sterile buffer solution in a 125-milliliter plastic bottle to make the first dilution. Bottles were agitated on a wrist-action shaker for 20 minutes, and a 10-milliliter aliquot was taken from each sample using sterilized pipette tips and added to 90 milliliters of sterile buffer solution to make the second dilution. The bottle containing the second dilution for each sample was agitated for 10 seconds by hand, poured into a sterile tray, and the second dilution was inoculated directly onto Biolog EcoPlates using a sterilized pipette set to deliver 150 microliters into each well. Each plate was immediately covered, placed in a covered box and incubated in the dark at 25 degrees Celcius. Catabolism of each carbon substrate produced a proportional color change response (from the color of the inoculant to dark purple) due to the activity of the redox dye tetrazolium violot (present in all wells including blanks). Plates were read at intervals of 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours and 120 hours after inoculation using a Biolog MicroStation plate reader (Biolog, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) reading absorbance at 590 nanometers.For each soil sample and at each incubation time point, average well color development (AWCD) was calculated according to the equation:AWCD = [Σ (C – R)] / n where C represents the absorbance value of control wells (mean of 3 controls), R is the mean absorbance of the response wells (3 wells per carbon substrate), and n is the number of carbon substrates (31 for EcoPlates). For each soil sample, an incubation curve was constructed using AWCD values from 48 hours to 120 hours, and the area under this incubation curve was calculated. The numeric values contained in the fields of this dataset represent areas under these AWCD incubation curves from 48 hours to 120 hours. Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014).References:Cartwright, J. (2014).

				<procdesc>An unpublished polygon shapefile of 40 limestone glades within Stones River National Battlefield was acquired (National Park Service, undated). Following preliminary field visits to determine accessibility, 12 of the 40 glades were chosen for study (for details on glade selection methodology see Cartwright, 2014). The ArcGIS Buffer tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a 3-meter buffer around each glade polygon. The ArcGIS Create Random Points tool (Esri, 2010) was used to create a point feature class of 120 random sampling locations within and near the 12 glades; 80% of the points were generated within the glade interiors, and 20% of the points were generated within their 3-meter buffers. From these points, 36 were selected for soil data collection and analysis (for details on methodology for selection of soil points see Cartwright, 2014). Detailed descriptions of experimental design, field data collection procedures, laboratory procedures, and data analysis are presented in Cartwright (2014). For details about tabular attributes included in this data set, see the entity and attributes section of this metadata document.
