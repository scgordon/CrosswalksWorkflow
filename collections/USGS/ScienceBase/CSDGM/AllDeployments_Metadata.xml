      <abstract>Data include Rhodamine WT dye concentrations measured every 3 or 10 minutes by means of Turner Designs C-3 and C-6 fluorometers with internal dataloggers at three fixed locations on the Des Plaines River (DPR) (DP-1, DP-2, and DP-3); in three groundwater monitoring wells (ACL-1, WP10-85, and WP9-275); and at two fixed locations on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC) (SC-1 and SC-2) (see included Google Earth file  AllDeployments_Locations.kmz). The detection limit for these fluorometers is reported to be 0.01 parts per billion (ppb). However, the fluorometer readings were affected by turbidity, and readings of less than about 1.0 part per billion (ppb) were considered to have been influenced by turbidity and variability in background fluorescence rather than indicative of the detection of dye.&#xD;
 Measurements began prior to the arrival of dye at all locations (to ensure background concentrations were properly documented) and continued for 3â€“13 days after tracer injection ceased, depending on the location. Fluorometers were calibrated the day prior to the start of the study by using water from the site where the fluorometer was to be deployed to make the final dilution of the calibration solution. Turbidity sensors were not calibrated and therefore report only relative changes in background turbidity and not absolute turbidity values (all fluorometers either reported relative turbidity values in relative fluorescence units (RFU) or in Nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)). Fluorometers installed in the wells were deployed at the depths of hydraulically active fractures in each well. The fluorometer installed in the CSSC at the bottom of the ACL slip (SC-2) was mounted to a weighted frame and deployed adjacent to the canal wall near a potential hydraulically active fracture on the canal wall. The fluorometer placed upstream in the CSSC (SC-1) was a C-6 fluorometer, and it was deployed at U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamgage 05536890 at a depth of approximately 10 feet below the water surface in an attempt to document any dye infiltration upstream of this site.  All deployment locations are given in the provided Google Earth KMZ file.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were collected during a dye tracing study of the lower Des Plaines River and lower Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in November 2011 by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The study attempted to identify potential inflows of Des Plaines River water through the fractured bedrock that separates the two water bodies. Dye was injected into the Des Plaines River at 422481 m E, 4617942 m N (UTM WGS84 Zone 16N).  The dye was injected at three locations in the cross section to help ensure even distribution of the tracer in the river. Injection began at 1050 hours on November 15, 2011, and ended at 1200 hours on November 16. A total of approximately 57 gallons of Rhodamine WT in a 20 percent solution was used in the study. The target dye concentration in the Des Plaines River throughout the reach of interest was 20 parts per billion. All times are in Central Standard Time.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Turbidity created by barges led to apparent increases in dye concentration. After reviewing the data and accounting for turbidity-induced spikes (the C3 fluorometer includes a turbidity sensor), no dye was detected in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.&#xD;

        <procdesc>Raw data files were downloaded from the deployed instruments and imported to each worksheet of the Excel spreadsheet.  When necessary, outliers due to turbidity spikes were identified and the data were plotted against time for comparison.  The "samples" worksheet in the spreadsheet shows concentrations of Rhodamine WT dye in grab samples collected at some of the deployment locations and in wetlands between the Des Plaines River and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship canal.  Samples were collected and stored in 150 mL opaque plastic sample bottles and concentrations were measured with a Turner Designs 10-AU benchtop fluorometer.</procdesc>
