         <abstract>This dataset is a map of land use and vegetation for the Island of Maui, Hawaii, circa 2010. This dataset is a modified version of the U.S. Geological Survey LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type map (LANDFIRE.HI_110EVT, Refresh 2008) for the Island of Maui, Hawaii. The LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type map was modified to create this map of land use and vegetation for use in a water-budget model. Modifications included converting the LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type map from a raster to a shapefile format, assigning land-use names, and adding golf-course and crop boundaries.</abstract>
         <purpose>This dataset was developed for use in a water-budget model that computes groundwater recharge, fog drip, irrigation, evapotranspiration, and runoff.</purpose>

Fields of sugarcane were digitized using a plantation-divisions map, dated July 2008, that was provided by Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company. Assign the following land-use name values and identification numbers (NAME_2010, ilu1010): (Sugarcane, 1); (Pineapple, 2); (Coffee, 3); (Diversified Agriculture, 4); and (Golf course, 24).</procdesc>

Agriculture polygons on the east slope of West Maui Mountain with groves of trees were redefined as "Macadamia".  Agriculture polygons in the LANDFIRE map that are adjacent to but not within the fields of sugarcane, pineapple, coffee, or taro were assigned a land-use name (NAME_2010) of "Grassland", "Developed, Low-intensity", or "Developed, Open space" on the basis of the land use for nearby polygons. Agriculture polygons that appeared in the imagery as being uncultivated and covered by grass were redefined as "Fallow/grassland". All remaining agriculture polygons that appeared in the imagery as being actively cultivated were redefined as "Diversified Agriculture". </procdesc>
