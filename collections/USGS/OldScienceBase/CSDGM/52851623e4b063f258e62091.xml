         <abstract>This dataset consists of a map depicting the distribution of sweetgum-oak mixed forests along the Natchez Trace Parkway. Ground-based vegetation classification was provided by the National Park Service and mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center. In the final version of "Mapping the Natchez Trace Parkway," the Sweetgum-Oak class was merged with the Sweetgum class because most of the time it co-occurred with the Sweetgum field sites. </abstract>
         <purpose>To provide the National Park Service with a separate map of Sweetgum-Oak class polygons in the Natchez Trace Parkway.  This shapefile can be layered over the map of the Parkway to identify sweetgum-oak mixed forest locations.</purpose>

            <taxonpro>National Park Service (NPS) personnel provided ground-based identification of a small sample of sweetgum-oak mixed forests based upon their expertise and pre-existing knowledge of tree  identification. An unsupervised classification was then performed on the filtered orthophotos of the Natchez Trace Parkway that identified many distinct spectral groups. The analyst correlated the field site data with the unsupervised classification and identified one of these spectral groups as sweetgum-oak. All other areas of similar spectra were also classified as sweetgum-oak.</taxonpro>
            <taxoncom>The trees identified in this dataset are classified as sweetgum and oak (Alliance codes = A.234, A.291, and A.292) in the 1998 National Vegetation Classification Standard (NVCS).  The NVCS classifies similar species together into alliances and associations. Association is the finest floristic level in the NVCS; an alliance represents an aggregation of associations. A single association includes a variety of plants that share similar habitat and physiognomy.  It is usually identified by a diagnostic species, in this case, sweetgum and oak. In this dataset, the sweetgum and oak associations include a variety of species and subspecies.</taxoncom>

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>National Vegetation Classification data compiled by the National Park Service (NPS) at ground sites throughout the Natchez Trace Parkway were used to assign the class descriptors in the landcover classifications.  A minimum of 30 independent accuracy assessment points per landcover was desired; however, this was not reached for all landcover classes. In this case, twenty-five points were identified by the NPS as sweetgum-oak mixed forests.  The unsupervised algorithm identified 17 of these points correctly, resulting in a 68 percent accuracy rate. 

For more information, see Table 5 in 'Mapping the Natchez Trace Parkway.'</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>Visual inspection and automated checking were performed on the data to confirm the integrity of the topology.</logic>
      <complete>This unsupervised classification of sweetgum-oak had an omission error rate of 32 percent. Comparison with National Park Service data suggested that many instances of sweetgum were misclassified as other landcover classes (omission error rate of 70 percent). Because of the underreporting of sweetgum, the final map output grouped sweetgum with sweetgum-oak (an alliance frequently grouped with sweetgum in unsupervised classification).</complete>

         <procstep>
            <procdesc>Color infrared (CIR) aerial photography was acquired during leaf-on conditions. The flights occurred on September 29-30 and October 6 and 15, 2004. The resulting aerial film rolls were then scanned at 25 microns by using a true color, true optics scanner to generate a 1,000-dot per inch (dpi) product and converted to DOQQs. The effects of tilt and relief were removed from the aerial photos by orthorectification.  The transformation of the photographic frames to DOQQ representation provided uniform scale. Uniform scale allowed the direct measure of true distance and direction.  The tiles were then cut to match existing DOQQs in the UTM projection zones.  

The 235 DOQQs created from the 386 aerial frames were mosaicked to create full coverage of the Parkway. The resulting file was too large for most computers to handle and was divided into 11 mosaics. These 11 mosaic sections, at the request of the National Park Service (NPS), were further subdivided into tiles (10 tiles/mosaic) only for NPS use.

         <procstep>
            <procdesc>An 11 m by 25 m (average) spectral filter was applied to the DOQQs to produce a scale comparable to the 20 m by 50 m ground-plot size used by the National Park Service. This filter was applied to each of the 11 mosaic sections of the Parkway imagery. The filter minimized unwanted canopy variability (irregularly illuminated tree crowns and canopy gaps and associated shadowing) and maximized forest-stand identification.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>An unsupervised classification (accomplished numerically and impartially with little human input) was performed on the images produced from the generated DOQQs. This process involved aggregating the pixels into spectral groupings, or clusters, based solely on the spectral distribution present in the image. The analyst then determined the landcover identity of the sweetgum-oak spectral groups by associating the classified image data with ground reference data from the National Park Service (NPS) classification and notes from field reconnaissance missions.  When other areas of similar spectra were distinguishable, the pixels were also classified as sweetgum-oak. This shapefile was an interim product for the NPS created before the final completion of the map.  In the final mapping output, sweetgum-oak was grouped with sweetgum.
