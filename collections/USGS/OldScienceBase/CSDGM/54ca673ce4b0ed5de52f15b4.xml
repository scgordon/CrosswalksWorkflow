         <abstract>The National High Altitude Photography (NHAP) program, which was operated from 1980-1989, was coordinated by the U.S. Geological Survey as an interagency project to eliminate duplicate photography in various Government programs.  The aim of the program was to cover the 48 conterminous states over a 5-year span.  In the NHAP program, black-and-white and color-infrared aerial photographs were obtained on  9-inch film from an altitude of 40,000 feet above mean terrain elevation and are centered over USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles.  The color-infrared photographs are at a scale of 1:58,000 (1 inch equals about .9 miles), and the black-and-white photographs are at a scale of 1:80,000 (1 inch equals about 1.26 miles). All NHAP flights where flown in a North to South direction. These photographs are offered as digital images. </abstract>
         <purpose>The NHAP program was designed to reduce Federal costs, eliminate duplication of effort, and to obtain complete, uniform coverage of the conterminous 48 states of the USA over a 5-year cycle.</purpose>

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the photo image. Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during a mosaicing process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images to improve their tone.</attraccr>
