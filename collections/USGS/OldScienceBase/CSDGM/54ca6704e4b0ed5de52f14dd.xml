         <abstract>The Earth Observing-1(EO-1)satellite was launched on November 21, 2000 by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)as a one-year technology demonstration mission to evaluate the performance of advanced capabilities for future space missions.  The EO-1 mission validated highly integrated multispectral data from the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) sensor and hyperspectral imaging data from the Hyperion sensor. After the initial technology mission was accomplished, NASA and the USGS agreed to continue the EO-1 program due to high interest in the specialized data from scientific communities. 

EO-1 Data products consist of imagery collected during the original one-year mission, as well as more recent Data Acquisition Requests (DARs) from the EO-1 Extended Mission. EO-1 scenes are processed to Level 1Gst (L1Gst) and images with adequate ground control points are processed to Level 1T (L1T). L1Gst and L1T products are provided in GeoTIFF format.  Scenes that have been processed to L1T are also available as Full Resolution Browse and GIS Ready Bundle products in JPEG format.  Level 1R (L1R) products in HDF format are only available for Hyperion data.
</abstract>
         <purpose>Hyperion collects 220 unique spectral channels ranging from 0.357 to 2.576 micrometers with a 10 nm bandwidth. The instrument operates in a pushbroom fashion, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. Hyperion has a scene width of 7.7 kilometers and a standard length of 42 kilometers with an optional increased length of 185 kilometers.  Additional information is available at http://eo1.usgs.gov, and http://eo1.gsfc.nasa.gov.</purpose>
         <supplinf>Data Acquisition Requests (DARS) must be submitted to request an image acquisition for a specific area of interest (http://eo1.usgs.gov/dar/instructions). EO-1 does not acquire data continuously and its sensors are only activated to collect specific scenes upon request. 

Although the ALI and Hyperion instruments continues to collect data for the extended mission, recently acquired scenes may not align directly with the WRS-2 path and row due to the degradation of the EO-1 orbit as the satellite draws closer to end of mission.

         <attraccr>The identification of features is provided by the distinct electromagnetic energy it emits,reflects, or otherwise transmits.  This is called the spectral signature.  Other signatures such as tone (lightness or darkness), texture (surface roughness or smoothness), pattern,shadow, shape, and size are as important.  Thus, through the use of the thematic mapper</attraccr>
