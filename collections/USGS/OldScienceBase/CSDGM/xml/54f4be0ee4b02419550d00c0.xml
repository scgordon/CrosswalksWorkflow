         <abstract>LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform.  Using a combination of laser rangefinding, GPS positioning and inertial measurement technologies; LiDAR instruments are able to make highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures and vegetation.</abstract>
         <purpose>LiDAR data is used for 3D visualization, elevation based analysis and for feature extraction.</purpose>
         <supplinf>Reflective surface data represents the DEM created by laser energy reflected from the first surface encountered by the laser pulse. Some energy may continue beyond this initial surface to be reflected by a subsequent surface as represented by the Last Return data. Intensity information is captured from the Reflective Surface pulse and indicates the relative energy returned to the sensor as compared to the energy transmitted.  Points are classified as on ground surface or not on ground surface to support creation of a bare earth model from the data.</supplinf>

            <procdesc>The LiDAR data was captured using AERO-METRIC's twin-engine Aero Commander equipped with a LiDAR system. The LiDAR system includes a differential GPS unit and inertial measurement system to provide superior accuracy. Acquisition parameters: 1. Scanner - Optech ALTM 3100EA 2. Flight Height - 1700m above mean terrain 3. Swath Width - 18degrees 4. Sidelap - 33% 5. Nominal Post Spacing - 1.2m. GPS and IMU processing parameters: 1. Processing Programs and version - Applanix - POSGPS and POSProc, versions 4.31 2. Max PDOP during LiDAR collection - 3.0 3. Max distance from GPS base stations during collection - less than 25km 4. Mean differential baseline length - 15km 5. Minimum number of base stations during LiDAR collection - 2 6. IMU processing monitored for consistency and smoothness - Yes. Point Cloud Processing: 1. Program and version - Dashmap, version 3.0005 2. Horizontal Datum - NAD83(NSRS2007) 3. Horizontal Coordinates - Illinois State Plane Coordinates, East Zone, in US Survey Feet 4. Vertical Datum - NAVD88 5. Geoid Model used to reduce satellite derived elevations to orthometric heights - NGS Geoid03. LIDAR Processing: 1. Processing Programs and versions - TerraSolid TerraScan (version 008.009) and TerraMatch (version 008.006) and Intergraph MicroStation (version.08.01.02.15). 2. Point Cloud data is imported to TerraScan in a Microstation V8 (V) CAD environment on an approximate 5000ft by 5000ft tiling scheme. 3. Analyze the data for overall completeness and consistency. This is to ensure that there are no voids in the data collection. 4. Inspect for calibration errors in the dataset using the TerraMatch software. This is accomplished by sampling the data collected accross all flight lines and classify the idividual lines to ground. The sofware will use the ground-classified lines to compute corrections (Heading, Pitch, Roll, and Scale). 5. Orientation corrections are then applied to the entire dataset. 6. Automatic ground classification is performed using algorithms with customized parameters to best fit the project area. Several areas of varying relief and planimetric features were inspected to verify the final ground surface. 7. AERO-METRIC, INC. provided Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC) data for this project. AERO-METRIC captured 103 QA/QC points in multipled land cover categories that were used to test the accuracy of the LiDAR ground surface. TerraScan's Output Control Report (OCR) was used to compare the QAQC data to the LIDAR data. This routine searches the LIDAR dataset by X &amp; Y coordinate, finds the closest LIDAR point and compares the vertical (Z) values to the known data collected in the field. Based on the QAQC data, a bias adjustment of -0.459 feet was determined, and the results were applied to the LIDAR data. A final OCR was performed with a resulting RMSE of 0.28 feet. 8. Once the automatic processing and the testing of LiDAR is complete, AERO-METRIC meticulously reviews the generated bare-earth surface data to insure that proper classification was achieved as part of a Quality Control process. 9. Contour shapefiles were created and merged into a geodatabase. Topology checks were done in ArcInfo to check for dangles, overlaps, and self-intersecting contours. Several iterations of this process were done to ensure clean contour topology before the final shapefiles were created. 10. Final deliverable are generated. Final Deliverables: 1. One paper and digital copy of the ABGPS and Ground Survey Report and Vertical Assessment Report. 2. External Firewire drive(s) containing Bare Earth LiDAR data in ASCII format (x,y,z,i) - comma delimited. x=Easting (0.01 resolution), y=Northing (0.01 resolution), z=Elevation (0.01 resolution), i=Intensity (0.1 resolution) 3. External Firewire drive(s) containing the LiDAR classified data in .las format 4. External Firewire drive(s) containing the generated 2 foot contours in ESRI Shapefile format. 5. External Firewire drive(s) containing the breaklines in ESRI Shapefile format. 6. External Firewire drive(s) containing FGDC Compliant metadata</procdesc>
