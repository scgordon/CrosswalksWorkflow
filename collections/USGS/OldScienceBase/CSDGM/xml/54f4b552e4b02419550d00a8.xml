         <abstract>LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform.  Using a combination of laser rangefinding, GPS positioning and inertial measurement technologies; LiDAR instruments are able to make highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures and vegetation.</abstract>
         <purpose>LiDAR data is used for 3D visualization, elevation based analysis and for feature extraction.</purpose>
         <supplinf>Reflective surface data represents the DEM created by laser energy reflected from the first surface encountered by the laser pulse. Some energy may continue beyond this initial surface to be reflected by a subsequent surface as represented by the Last Return data. Intensity information is captured from the Reflective Surface pulse and indicates the relative energy returned to the sensor as compared to the energy transmitted.  Points are classified as on ground surface or not on ground surface to support creation of a bare earth model from the data.</supplinf>

      <complete>The LiDAR data is checked for quality and completeness during, and immediately following each mission. Coverage and accuracy is verified in the office as the data is sent. Elevation products are opened and visually reviewed for completeness. File sizes and numbers of files are also reviewed as products are loaded onto hard drives for delivery
LiDAR raster data is visually inspected for completeness to ensure that any gaps between flight lines or loss of signal represents less than 5% of required collection area. Areas of open water where loss of LiDAR signal is common are corrected to the best estimate of water level at time of collection. LiDAR is self-illuminating and has minimal cloud penetration capability. Water vapor in steam plumes or particulates in smoke may cause reflection of LiDAR signals and loss of elevation information beneath these plumes. Glass structures and roofs may appear transparent to the LiDAR signal and therefore may not register on the reflective surface. Some asphalt formulations have been shown to absorb topographic LiDAR wavelength energy resulting in "pitting" of roof surfaces using this material.</complete>

            <procdesc>Data Collection: Using a Leica ALS50 Phase 2 MPIA Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) system, flight lines of standard density (1.4-meter ground sample distance) data were collected over Peoria County, Illinois (~649 square miles). Multiple returns were recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return. The data acquisition occurred between March 25, 2008 and March 29th, 2008. During the LIDAR campaign, the field crew onducted a GPS field survey to establish final coordinates of the ground base stations for final processing of the base-remote GPS solutions. Airborne global positioning system (GPS) base stations were used to support the LiDAR data acquisition.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>Airborne GPS Processing: Airborne GPS data was differentially processed and integrated with the post processed IMU data to derive an (SOL) solution file, Leica's version of an (SBET) smoothed best estimate of trajectory. The SOL was used to reduce the LiDAR slant range measurements to a raw reflective surface for each flight line. The overlap between flight lines was removed to provide a homogeneous coverage, and the coverage was classified to extract a bare earth digital elevation model (DEM). Airborne GPS is differentially processed using the GrafNAV V7.50 software by Waypoint Consulting of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. IMU data is processed using the IPAS Pro V1.22 software by Leica Geosystems of St. Gallen, Switzerland. The reflective surface is derived using the ALS Post Processor software by Leica Geosystems GIS &amp; Mapping Division of Atlanta, Georgia. The classification of LiDAR data is carried out using TerraScan software by Terrasolid Limited of Helsinki, Finland. The quality control (QC) and calibration is completed using VG4D software by Virtual Geomatics, Inc of Austin, Texas</procdesc>
