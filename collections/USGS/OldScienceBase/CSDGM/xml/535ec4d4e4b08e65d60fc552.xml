         <abstract>The objectives of this study were to determine the origin of Buttonwood Ridge and define its role in ecologic history of the area.</abstract>
         <purpose>The peninsula of Florida is separated from Florida Bay by a coastal ridge called the Buttonwood Embankment.  The Buttonwood Embankment, averaging 0.5 m (1.5 ft) in height, was characterized in 1964 as the "embankment that impounds the freshwater of the lower three counties of Florida".  However, the creeks, lakes, and ponds adjacent to the embankment are presently brackish to marine.  The change from fresh to brackish waters has been detrimental to the marsh. Studies have been launched to determine the best methods to reestablish and sustain a more fresh/estuarine environment. To judiciously plan for this restoration two questions have been posed to clarify the history of the area. (1) Have the environmental changes over the years resulted from rising sea level, hydrologic management practices, or both? and (2) What is the role of the "Coastal Levee" in the hydrologic (surface and groundwater) regime of  southern Florida and Florida Bay?</purpose>

            <procdesc>Two transects of vibracores were analyzed that extend from the coast inland across the Buttonwood Ridge. These transects provide information on the timing of sea-level rise and changing sedimentation patterns on the Ridge.  An additional transect of cores were collected from peat deposits adjacent to three lakes along Taylor Creek.  These progress from brackish water in dwarf mangrove forests to fresh-water conditions of a sawgrass marsh. 210Pb profiles from these cores demonstrate the occurrence of two distinct episodes of sediment accumulation. Comparison of aerial photographs taken in 1940 and 1990 clearly shows that a change from a lake to a mangrove marsh along Taylor Creek. Several cores were collected in northernmost Florida Bay, and radiometric dating of cores from the mouths of Little Madeira Bay and Joe Bay and a core collected on Pass Key bank indicates increased sediment accumulation rates during the past few decades.</procdesc>
