This DNA fingerprinting study investigates whether
females of the brood parasite brown-headed
cowbird, Molothrus ater, associate with their own
juvenile ffspring at feeding sites more often than
would be expected by chance. Cowbirds lay their
eggs in the nests of a  variety of host species
and, as far as is known, leave them to the care of
foster parents. Using baited walk-in funnel traps,
36 adult female-juvenile pairs (or trios) of
cowbirds were trapped.  Blood samples were
collected from these individuals to conduct DNA
fingerprinting analyses, calculate similarity
indices, and to compare S-values for the 11
comparisons of juveniles and the females with
which they were caught with S-values of random
pairings of juveniles and the females in adjacent
gel lanes with which they were not caught. Overall
band-sharing was  significantly higher for the
individuals trapped together than for the random
pairings. These  associations between juvenile
cowbirds and their mothers could occur as a result
of female cowbirds monitoring the development of
their young in the nests where they have laid.
Alternatively, nestling cowbirds in the nest could
become familiar visually and vocally with a female
parent that is frequently present in their
territory and could follow her when she departs
for feeding grounds. In either case these data
suggest that adult cowbirds associate with
juveniles, in some cases their own offspring, and
that offspring may learn to function as cowbirds
in part from this association.
