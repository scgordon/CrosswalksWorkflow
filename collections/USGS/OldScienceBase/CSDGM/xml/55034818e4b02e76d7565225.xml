         <abstract>The LIMS (laboratory information management system) database is a computerized record of specimens - from serum samples to carcasses - sent to the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) for processing and diagnostic workup. Data include history and recordkeeping information (identifier numbers, species, sex, submitter information, etc); types of tests run (virology, bacteriology, parasitology, chemistry, etc.) and some test results for heavy metals, particularly lead; and diagnostic results. The diagnostic coding system is based on SNOMED terminology, with certain modifications and additions to fit Center needs. SNOMED, the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, is a structured nomenclature and classification of the terminology used in human and veterinary medicine. Terms are assigned in any or all of the following six categories for each diagnosis: topography - detailed anatomic term for the site of interest; morphology - information on the pathogenic change or process associated with the topography; etiology - cause or causal agent of the disease or dysfunction; disease - disease, disease entity or syndrome; link - qualifier to link one diagnosis to another.</abstract>
         <purpose>LIMS is a process-based record of samples sent to NWHC, and includes documentation on how samples and data move through the Center, as well as results information sent back to the submitter and other contacts. It may not be a representative sample of mortality for any particular species or group; however, the database can be used to determine if a disease/syndrome existed. For example, the database can be used to document avian cholera in mallards in California at a particular location or time, but it cannot be used to say that there was more cholera in 1990 than in 1980, since the number of specimens submitted for diagnostic workup does not necessarily reflect the total number of mortalities. Individuals interested in documenting total mortalities should reference the Epizootiological Database (EPIZOO), also maintained at NWHC.</purpose>
         <supplinf>LIMSs not currently accessible outside NWHC. However, with assistance from
appropriate Center personnel, searches of the database will be performed on request to the system manager. A complete system overhaul, including interfaces to other portions of the overall NWHC wildlife mortality database e.g. EPIZOO) is in the planning stage.

This dataset is not for a single research project, with a study plan, a defined time frame, and a finite number of options for collecting, storing and analyzing data.  This is a long term dataset documenting wildlife mortality and has been growing, changing and evolving over the last 40 years.  The number of people involved in providing and processing information over the years reaches into the thousands.</supplinf>

            <taxoncom>Species were coded to the lowest taxonomic category possible - since we are dealing with dead animals, in some cases, decomposition only allowed for coding to order or family.  However, in most cases, specimens were coded to genus/species and in some cases to subspecies.  All codes are mapped to ITIS.</taxoncom>
