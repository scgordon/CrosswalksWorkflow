         <abstract>Aeromagnetic data were collected along flight lines by instruments in an
aircraft that recorded magnetic-field values and locations.  This dataset
presents latitude, longitude, altitude, and magnetic-field values.</abstract>
         <purpose>Aeromagnetic surveys are used for geophysical prospecting.  Some variations in
magnetic measurements are caused by rocks that contain significant amounts of
magnetic minerals (magnetite being the most common).  These anomalies reflect
variations in the amount and type of magnetic material and the shape and depth
of the body of rock. The features and patterns of aeromagnetic anomalies can
also be used to delineate details of subsurface geology including the locations
of buried faults and the thickness of surficial sedimentary rocks.</purpose>

         <attraccr>The data in this file have been processed using various formulas and

      <logic>The data in this file were collected by a single contractor or group
who were responsible for collecting and processing the data.
The data from this survey were collected using the same instruments
(magnetometers, altimeters, navigational systems) throughout the survey
and were collected in a normal length of time with no long delays
between survey beginning and end.
Survey contracts specified the conditions and specifications under which
these data were collected.  Standard industry practices of the time
were followed in data collection and processing.</logic>
      <complete>Loss of data due to poor transmission, channel dropout, obvious spiking,
missing channels, and other obvious errors may have been replaced with the
value -9999.9.</complete>

            <horizpar>Horizontal positions of the survey aircraft used to collect
data were determined using GPS satellite navigation.</horizpar>
         </horizpa>
         <vertacc>
            <vertaccr>The aircraft vertical position was determined using the navigational
positioning equipment on the aircraft, which were radar altimeter
and barometric altimeter.
Radar altimeters are estimated to have an error of 2-5% of the
altitude (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc., written communication).
Barometric altimeters are quite accurate, but are typically operated
in an uncorrected mode.  The diurnal variation in air pressure over
the course of a flight can produce a 50-100 ft error in the barometric
altimeter reading.  In addition, pressure microcells create short-
period air pressure changes equivalent to about 10 ft. under typical
conditions (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc., written communication)
This data set was collected as a draped survey having an average
terrain clearance of 200 ft.  Because aircraft cannot safely maintain
a constant terrain clearance, error in vertical position is introduced.</vertaccr>
