Polar bears were captured up to 160 km from the coast in the U.S. portion of the southern Beaufort Sea from late March to early May from 2001 to 2010. The communities of Barrow, Deadhorse, and Kaktovik were used as logistical bases to support field operations, excluding Barrow in 2001 and Kaktovik in 2006. Adult, subadult, and yearling bears were captured using projectile syringes containing the immobilizing drug Telazol™ that were fired from a helicopter. Cubs of the year were manually captured and injected with a light dose of Telazol™ immediately prior to handling. All individuals were given two identifying marks: a unique identification number was tattooed on the inner lip and ear tags, containing the same unique identification number, were placed in both ears. Captures were nonselective with respect to gender and age, however females with radio collars were often targeted for capture in order to retrieve collars. All field procedures were approved by the USGS Alaska Science Center Animal Care and Use Committee.</supplinf>

Ages of bears first captured as dependent young were determined based on their size. Cubs-of-the-year are easily distinguished because of their small size. Yearlings and 2-year-olds are generally one-third and two-thirds the size of their mother, respectively. Ages of bears first captured as independent animals were estimated by counting annuli in a cross section of a vestigial premolar tooth sample performed by either a lab at the University of Alberta or C-D and Associates Biological Consulting. Estimating age from annuli is usually very accurate for young bears, but accuracy may decrease as age increases.</attrdef>

Following each flight mission, the GPS data were downloaded from the GPS unit to a computer and plotted on a map using standard mapping software. The number does not include time spent ferrying from one logistical base to another, flying directly to logistical bases to refuel or at the end of a flight mission. The number does include any time spent flying over the sea ice and directly from logistical bases to location waypoints to resume following previously detected tracks or to the last known locations of satellite radio collared/tagged individuals only when the flight crew actively searched for bears along the way.</attrdef>
