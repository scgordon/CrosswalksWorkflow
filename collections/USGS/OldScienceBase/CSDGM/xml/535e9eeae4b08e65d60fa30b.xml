         <purpose>The spatial distribution and disposition of known wells is critical to analyze both subsalt and suprasalt petroleum systems in the Afghan-Tajik and Amu Darya basins.</purpose>
         <supplinf>As part of the U.S. Government's effort to aid in reconstructing Afghanistan's economy and infrastructure, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is cooperating with the Afghanistan Ministry of Mines and Industry (AMMI) to assess the undiscovered petroleum (includes crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids/condensates) resources of Afghanistan. Funding for this effort was provided by the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</supplinf>

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>Attribute accuracy is dependent upon accuracy of source materials. Names used in this data set are the result of an iterative process of verification and normalization. Most of the source materials use names transliterated into the Russian Cyrillic alphabet from Dari and other Afghan languages written with modified Farsi Arabic script. This introduced some inconsistencies because of limitations with Cyrillic and Russian usage, e.g. "Herat" becomes "Gerat." In transliterating from the Russian Cyrillic alphabet to the Roman alphabet, USGS attempted to render the names phonetically and to adhere to common principles of English usage in spelling words of Afghan origin, e.g. Russian "Dzhuma" is here given as "Juma" in the attribute item "USGS_name." Amir Mohammad Selab of the Afghanistan Ministry of Mines and Industry Joint Oil and Gas Resource Assessment Team was consulted to decide final English spelling of the identified drilled structures. A more direct transliteration from Russian in a form sometimes found in the literature is found in the attribute item "Alt_name." Tectonic zones digitized from the Klochko map were labeled with Roman numerals for major divisions and small letters for minor divisions. Because the order of letters is different in the Roman and Russian Cyrillic alphabets the tectonic zone labels are given in both orders. The item "Tzone_eng" gives the subdivisions in Roman alphabetic order - (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h). The item "Tzone_rus" gives the subdivisions in transliterated Russian Cyrillic alphabetic order - (a,b,v,g,d,e,zh,z).</attraccr>

         <horizpa>
            <horizpar>This dataset is a compilation of locations from several heterogenous sources and the positional accuracy varies accordingly. The locations of those wells which were located and surveyed with hand held GPS receivers by Afghanistan Ministry of Mines and Industry (MMI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Gustavson and Associates (GA) personnel have the most reliable and accurate locations with an accuracy exceeding 30 meters. Wells with locations digitized from an unpublished map of seismic line locations and wells provided by MMI have the next best reliability. When the map was registered with GPS locations of wells depicted on the map an RMS error of 40.9 meters was achieved. The GPS well locations were projected to a Gauss-Kruger projection and a Pulkovo 1942 datum with a transformation parameter to overcome distortions of base maps used by Soviet cartographers for security reasons. Because the Sheberghan - Sari Pul region map (Les'kiv) was compiled on the same base as the seismic line and well map, well locations from it that were also present on the seismic map were adjusted to the registration made with the GPS well locations. (Though there were many wells in common, all were not.) An RMS error of 172.68 meters was achieved. Many well locations were derived by Gustavson and Associates from interpolations from maps and reports in their possession. When possible, these locations were replaced by coordinates digitized from maps registered and rectified by USGS. In cases where the interpolated coordinates were the only location data available, they were kept. Their reliability cannot be quantified. When named wells were reported to exist in structures, but locations were not available, the centerpoint of the structure was used as the best location possible. These centerpoint locations were taken preferentially from the Les'kiv map, the structures map of Klochko and lastly from the Tectonic regions map of Bratash. The reliability of these centerpoint locations cannot be quantified - they indicate the theoretical center of the structure and not the location of any given well. The source of the well's coordinates is given in this dataset's attribute table in the items Co_type (coordinate type) and Co_source (coordinate source.) Users are advised that those wells with GPS coordinates and locations digitized from the seismic are in compliance with national mapping data standards, but that other data do not meet national mapping accuracy standards.</horizpar>
