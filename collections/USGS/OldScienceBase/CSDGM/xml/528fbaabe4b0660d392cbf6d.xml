      <descript>
         <abstract>The CAPTURE Program computes estimates of capture probability and population size for ''closed'' population capture-recapture data. Estimation of abundance produces an estimate of the number of individuals in the population at risk of capture.  Point estimates along with 95% confidence intervals are produced.</abstract>
         <purpose>The program CAPTURE consists of two executable components: an analytical component that performs abundance and density estimation from information provided by the user, and a new component allowing easy data entry.</purpose>

         <ordering>The FTP server is located at ftp://pwrcftpr.er.usgs.gov/research. This should have no effect on downloading files. If you have trouble, please let the distributor know. The programs are stored as "zip" archives. Most of the zip files contain both the source code (usually FORTRAN) and IBM-PC compatible executable files. If you need an unzipping program, you can download a free Windows unzipper [PowerArc] or a free MSDOS unzipper [unzip.exe].</ordering>

      <techpreq>These programs are designed to run on any IBM-PC compatible computers. Monochrome and color displays are supported. To speed execution, CAPTURE has been compiled (using the Ryan-McFarland FORTRAN compiler) using the capability of a numeric coprocessor (Intel 80x87 chip). If this chip is not present in the user's computer, CAPTURE will generate an Error 4001 message. Another requirement of the user's computer is adequate memory availability. After loading all memory-resident programs (TSRs, network BIOS, etc.), the user's computer must have approximately 540Kb of available memory to be able to use 2CAPTURE in concert with CAPTURE. Both programs must be resident in memory simultaneously and CAPTURE is approximately 430Kb in size. and 2CAPTURE is 110Kb in size.  The maximum size of analysis problem that can be handled by CAPTURE in this release is 18 capture occasions, 8 nested grids for density estimation, and 1000 animals in simulation experiments. If the user wishes to exceed any of these limitations, CAPTURE must be recompiled after making the requisite modifications to the file PARMTR.INC. Increasing any of these limits will increase the size of the program, necessitating even greater memory requirements.</techpreq>
