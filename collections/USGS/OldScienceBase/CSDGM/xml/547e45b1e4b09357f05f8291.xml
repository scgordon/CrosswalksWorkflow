         <abstract>The Alaska Geochemical Database (AGDB) was created and designed to compile and integrate geochemical data from Alaska in order to facilitate geologic mapping, petrologic studies, mineral resource assessments, definition of geochemical baseline values and statistics, environmental impact assessments, and studies in medical geology. This Microsoft Access database serves as a data archive in support of present and future Alaskan geologic and geochemical projects, and contains data tables describing historical and new quantitative and qualitative geochemical analyses. The analytical results were determined by 85 laboratory and field analytical methods on 264,095 rock, sediment, soil, mineral and heavy-mineral concentrate samples. Most samples were collected by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) personnel and analyzed in USGS laboratories or, under contracts, in commercial analytical laboratories. These data represent analyses of samples collected as part of various USGS programs and projects from 1962 to 2009. In addition, mineralogical data from 18,138 nonmagnetic heavy mineral concentrate samples are included in this database. The AGDB includes historical geochemical data originally archived in the USGS Rock Analysis Storage System (RASS) database, used from the mid-1960s through the late 1980s and the USGS PLUTO database used from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. All of these data are currently maintained in the Oracle-based National Geochemical Database (NGDB). Retrievals from the NGDB were used to generate most of the AGDB data set. These data were checked for accuracy regarding sample location, sample media type, and analytical methods used. This arduous process of reviewing, verifying and, where necessary, editing all USGS geochemical data resulted in a significantly improved Alaska geochemical dataset. USGS data that were not previously in the NGDB because the data predate the earliest USGS geochemical databases, or were once excluded for programmatic reasons, are included here in the AGDB and will be added to the NGDB. The AGDB data provided here are the most accurate and complete to date, and should be useful for a wide variety of geochemical studies. The AGDB data provided in the linked database may be updated or changed periodically. The data on the DVD and in the data downloads provided with this report are current as of date of publication.</abstract>

         <update>None is planned for the AGDB. The National Geochemical Database is currently being updated annually with new data although there is a deliberate lag time of 2-5 years before recent data are added. Some of these data may be within the boundaries of AGDB. The error-identification and correction process continues to generate changes at episodic intervals. Most changes are primarly related to 1) additional information on the exact sample medium analyzed, 2) adding location coordinates where there were none, and 3) correcting location coordinates known to be inaccurate.</update>

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>The data of this dataset represent analyses of geologic material samples collected in support of various USGS programs. The historical geochemical databases of the Geologic Discipline in the USGS were created with the intent of storing data predominately for regional projects. The new combined National Geochemical Database is an agglomerate of data from projects that had differing analytical needs and that ranged in scale from studies of an outcrop to reconnaissance surveys of an entire state or country. Initially, the intended user of the data was the original submitter or associated project personnel, and the primary means of publicly releasing data were hardcopy USGS reports, as well as professional journals. Within this paradigm, some decisions were made which have affected the completeness and accuracy of the attributes within the database.
&gt;1) Coordinates: When samples were brought in for analysis, the submitter was required to include information about the sample for the database; descriptions, geocoding, and latitude-longitude coordinates. In the days before map digitizing boards and GPS units were common, the determination of coordinates from field sheets was a time consuming and error prone process. In order to facilitate the analysis of samples, a decision was made to allow submitters to enter the coordinates for the lower right (southeast) corner of the submitter's working field map on which the samples could be plotted, which was most commonly a 7.5' or 15' quadrangle map. In theory, the precise coordinates for these samples would be determined and added to the database at a later date. In practice, most of these precise coordinates were used in the USGS Open-File data releases but were never entered back into the PLUTO database. Therefore, the precision of coordinates in the PLUTO database varies from "good to the nearest second of latitude or longitude" to "good to the nearest 15 minutes of latitude or longitude".
&gt;2) Geocoding: The submission of sample descriptive information (geocoding) with samples was mandatory for some fields and optional for others. Therefore, the completeness of geocoding can vary. In addition, most geocodes were not checked for completeness, accuracy, or validity during data entry into the early databases. Therefore the database contains some incorrect and invalid codes.
&gt;3) Analytical Data: The samples in this data set were chemically analyzed by a variety of techniques over a period of time from the early 1960's to the present. The accuracy of the data varies with the analytical methodology and with the concentration of the element being analyzed.
&gt;4) Qualifiers: A qualifier such as "N" (less than the detection limit of the analytical method) or "G" (greater than the upper determination limit of the analytical method) accompanies some analytical data values. These qualifiers are defined as follows:
&gt;"L" = the element was detected by the technique but at a level below the lower limit of determination for the method. The value of the lower limit of determination is given in the adjacent data field.
&gt;"G" or "&gt;" = the element was measured at a concentration greater than the upper determination limit for the method. The upper limit of determination is given in the adjacent data field.
&gt;"N" = the element was not detected at concentrations above the lower limit of determination for the method. The value of the lower limit of determination is given in the adjacent data field.
&gt;"&lt;" = the element concentration was determined to be less than the lower determination limit for the method for this element. The value of the lower limit of determination is given in the adjacent data field.</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>The AGDB dataset was constructed by processing a subset of the original National Geochemical Database (NGDB), adding relevant datasets that were not yet in the NGDB, checking for errors where possible, and using various selection criteria. The following criteria were chosen for selecting data for the rock data set:
&gt;Each sample must have a valid and unique lab number.
&gt;Each sample must have a latitude and longitude.
&gt;Each sample must be identified as geologic material (rock, sediment, soil, mineral or concentrate).
&gt;Each analytical determination must be linked to a valid and unique lab number.
&gt;Each analytical determination must be identified by analyte.
In addition, samples that could be identified as a processed derivative of geologic material, with the exception of heavy-mineral concentrates, were removed from the data set. This included single minerals, mineral separates, rock coatings, insoluble residues, partial digestions, and leachates.
The samples in this data set were collected for a variety of purposes. Not all samples were subject to the same sample preparation protocol or the same analytical protocol. The samples have been analyzed using documented techniques. For some elements, the methods of chemical analysis were the same throughout the study, while for others, the methods changed as analytical technology improved. Some of the methods used were specifically designed to give a concentration value based on a partial digestion or extraction of the sample. For these methods elements tightly bound in the structure of silicates in the sample are not measured. Therefore, the analytical results from these partial extraction techniques may not be comparable with results from methods designed to measure the total concentration of an element in a sample.</logic>
      <complete>This data set provides chemical data for Ag, Al, As, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Ga, Gd, Ge, F, Fe, Hf, Hg, Ho, I, In, Ir, K, La, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, Os, P, Pb, Pd, Pr, Pt, Rb, Re, Rh, Rn, Ru, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Si, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, Tm, U, V, W, Y, Yb, Zn, Zr, forms of carbon, forms of sulfur, forms of water, conductance, pH, density, and loss on ignition. In addition, the data set provides location and descriptive information for each sample. Not all the descriptive fields contain information for a particular sample because it was not recorded by the submitter or because it was never entered into the database. No sample will contain analyses for all possible elements. The analytical methods used were selected by the sample submitter based on the goals of the individual project and will vary throughout the data set. The analytical methods, sample preparation protocols, and quality control protocols used for various sample media by the USGS are documented in the bibliography table included in the database.

      <posacc>
         <horizpa>
            <horizpar>1) Coordinates: Most of the more recently submitted samples were located using GPS receivers. The locations determined by GPS should be accurate to the nearest latitude or longitude second. Older sample locations were determined primarily from USGS topographic maps of various scales. Sometimes these coordinates were determined directly from the original maps using a digitizing board. In other cases, a clear overlay with a coordinate grid was used to visually estimate the sample position on the map. The positional accuracy is dependant on the scale of the map from which the determination was made as well as the care taken by the individual(s) who plotted the sample or who made the coordinate determination. Unfortunately, some location coordinates were not carefully determined.
The determination of coordinates from field sheets was a time consuming and error prone process. In order to facilitate the analysis of samples, a decision was made to allow samples to be submitted to the laboratory using only the coordinates for the lower right (southeast) corner of the submitter's working field map on which the samples could be plotted, which was most commonly a 7.5' or 15' quadrangle map. In theory, the precise coordinates for these samples would be determined and added to the database at a later date. In practice, most of these more precise coordinates were used in resultant USGS Open-File data releases or publications but were never entered back into the database.
When submitters reported locations as degrees, minutes, and seconds of latitude and longitude the accuracy should be within a few seconds. When submitters only reported locations as degrees and minutes the accuracy is only to the nearest minute. When submitters only reported the corner coordinates of their field map, the accuracy is only to the nearest 7.5 or 15 minutes.
2) Datum and Earth Ellipsoid or Spheroid: When coordinates were submitted from GPS receivers or when the source of the coordinates were known, the datum and spheroid are identified in two fields that accompany the locational coordinates. For the majority of the data, these fields are empty. Since most of the older coordinate data in the database were determined from published maps, the best assumption is that the appropriate datum and spheroid is the one most conmmonly used for those types of maps. In the United States, most field maps were USGS topographic maps that used NAD27 (1927 North American datum) based on the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid. Using the wrong ellipsoid or datum may result in a location that is offset by up to a couple hundred feet.</horizpar>

         <procstep>
            <procdesc>Most of the data were generated by the Geologic Discipline analytical laboratories of the U.S. Geological Survey, beginning in the early 1960s. A small portion of these data predate this larger dataset and were never entered in any databases. Upon completion of the chemical analysis, the data were stored in the RASS database (1963 to 1987), the PLUTO database (1979 to 1997), or the specific commercial laboratory-information-management software (LIMS) used by the USGS analytical laboratories (1996 to present). Data from all three sources were combined, reformatted, and standardized into the Oracle-based National Geochemical Database (NGDB).
To create this data set, geologic material sample data were retrieved from the NGDB using the following criteria: 1) Each sample must have a valid and unique lab number; 2) Each sample must have latitude and longitude coordinates; and 3) Each sample must be identified as a rock, a sediment, a soil, or a heavy-mineral concentrate. This data set was then examined to remove any samples that could be identified as a processed derivative of a rock, a sediment, or a soil except for concentrates. This included single minerals, mineral separates, rock coatings, insoluble residues, partial digestions, leachates, experimental or artificial samples, and some misidentified samples. An effort was made to fix incorrect or incomplete attributes. Several standardized sample descriptive fields were more completely populated using information previously found only in comment fields. The sample location and descriptive data were repackaged into a single table called Geol. The sample location and descriptive data were again repackaged into 7 tables based upon media type: HMC_Geol, Mnrl_Geol, Rock_E_Geol, Rock_W_Geol, Sed_E_Geol, Sed_W_Geol, and Soil_Geol.
Analytical data associated with these samples were retrieved from the NGDB using the following criteria: 1) Each analytical determination must be linked to a valid and unique sample lab number; and 2) Each analytical determination must be identified by analyte. This data set was then examined to remove determinations that were requested but not completed, determinations that could not be quantified due to instrumental interferences, and duplicate determinations. In addition, multiple variations of similar analytical methods were consolidated into a single method name by element. For example: data for 17 variations of emission spectrographic determination for zinc were all combined into a single field called Zn_ppm_ES. These data were repackaged into a single table called Chem. The analytical data were again repackaged into 26 tables based upon media type and the consolidated analytical methods: HMC_Ag-Mg, HMC_Mn-Zr, Mnrl_Ag-Ga, Mnrl_Gd-Pt, Mnrl_Rb-Zr, Rock_E_Majors, Rock_E_Traces_Ag-Cr, Rock_E_Traces_Cs-Na, Rock_E_Traces_Nb-Sr, Rock_E_Traces_Ta-Zr, Rock_W_Majors, Rock_W_Traces_Ag-Cr, Rock_W_Traces_Cs-Na, Rock_W_Traces_Nb-Sr, Rock_W_Traces_Ta-Zr, Sed_E_Ag-Cr, Sed_E_Cs-Mn, Sed_E_Mo-Se, Sed_E_Si-Zr, Sed_W_Ag-Cr, Sed_W_Cs-Mn, Sed_W_Mo-Se, Sed_W_Si-Zr, Soil_Ag-Fe, Soil_Ga-Pt, and Soil_Rb-Zr.</procdesc>
