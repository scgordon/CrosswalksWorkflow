         <abstract>
The Banding Retrieval File contains summarized records for data
through the last full calendar year for all game birds banded since
1908, and for all nongame birds banded since 1954.  A summary record
includes all birds of the same species, age and sex, with the same status
and additional information codes, banded under the same permit
number, within the same region and 10-minute block of latitude and
longitude, during the same month and 5-day banding period, the same
band type, and band number prefix.
</abstract>
         <purpose>
Banding and encounter data are gathered and filed for the purpose of
facilitating migratory bird research in North America.
Waterfowl banding and encounter data are used by federal, state and
provincial wildlife agencies in combination with other data sets, to
help set federal hunting regulations.  In addition, many states and
provinces use banding and encounter data as a component of both game
and nongame studies.  Both banding and encounter data can be combined
with other data for work on bird distribution, migration, survival,
mortality, population size, and other demographic parameters.
</purpose>
         <supplinf>
The Banding Retrieval File contains over 9 million records
representing over 50 million birds processed through August 1995.  The file
increases by approximately 1.2 million birds each year.
Data are displayed in the following order:  species number, region,
year, permit, month, day code, status and additional information, age,
sex, latitude, longitude, direction code, prefix and part of band
suffix, total number of birds.  A file format is included with all
disks to assist the user in separating the fields.  Listings have the
fields separated and identified.
The numerical codes in the data can be translated with the aid of the
Bird Banding Manual, vol. 1 part 5 (described in
the section 1.15 Cross Reference). Status code in the first column
indicates that something was done to the bird upon recapture that changed
the original status.

      <useconst>
Bird Banding data maintained in the computer
files have been gathered at a significant cost to the many persons and
agencies who cooperate in the North American Bird Banding Program.
These cooperators have certain proprietary interests in the data they
produce.  The person who first bands a bird has prior publication
rights to any data resulting from that banding and/or subsequent
encounter of that band.  Information may be withheld where endangered
or threatened or sensitive species are involved.  To protect their
interests, a "Policy on Release" is included with each request,
describing current limiting criteria.
