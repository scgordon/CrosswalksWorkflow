         <abstract>
Bird banding is a universal and indispensable technique for studying
the movement, survival and behavior of birds. Data is collected by
numerous permitted individuals in both countries. The North American Bird
Banding Program is jointly administered by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
Biological Resources Division and the Canadian Wildlife Service. Their
respective banding offices have similar functions and policies and use
the same bands, reporting forms and data formats. Joint coordination of the
program dates back to 1923.
In the U.S., the Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) at Laurel, Maryland,
functions as a service and administrative center for those who use the
banding technique or banding data in their work.  BBL issues permits
and bands, supplies forms, instructional materials and technical advice,
coordinates the use of auxiliary markers such as colored leg bands and
radio transmitters, serves as the repository for banding data, serves
as the clearinghouse for reports of banded birds, disseminates banding
data to researchers and managers, and assists in the development and
coordination of banding projects. BBL edits and inputs data into its
Banding Encounter Database.
</abstract>
         <purpose>
Banding and encounter data are gathered and filed for the purpose of
facilitating migratory bird research in North America.
Waterfowl banding and encounter data are used by federal, state and
provincial wildlife agencies in combination with other data sets, to
help set federal hunting regulations.  In addition, many states and
provinces use banding and encounter data as a component of both game
and nongame studies.  Both banding and encounter data can be combined
with other data for work on bird distribution, migration, survival,
mortality, population size, and other demographic parameters.
</purpose>
         <supplinf>
The numerical codes in the data can be translated with the aid of the
Banding Manual (described in the section 1.15 Cross Reference). Status
code in the first column indicates that something was done to
the bird upon recapture that changed the original status.
Bird Encounter information can be viewed at http://www.mp1-pwrc.usgs.gov

Bird Banding data maintained in the computer
files have been gathered at a significant cost to the many persons and
agencies who cooperate in the North American Bird Banding Program.
These cooperators have certain proprietary interests in the data they
produce.  The person who first bands a bird has prior publication
rights to any data resulting from that banding and/or subsequent
encounter of that band.  Information may be withheld where endangered
or threatened or sensitive species are involved.  To protect their
interests, a "Policy on Release" is included with each request,
describing current limiting criteria.
