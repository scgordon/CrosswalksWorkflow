         <abstract>
This shapefile contains a representation of the
Anderson coal bed outcrop or contact with clinker,
Decker coalfield, Powder River Basin, southeast Montana.
This theme was created specifically for the USGS National
Coal Resource Assessment project in the Northern Rocky
Mountains and Great Plains Region.
</abstract>
         <purpose>
The Nation's coal resources are being assessed by the
USGS. This assessment identifies and characterizes the
coal beds and coal zones that will provide the bulk of the
Nation's coal-derived energy during the next few decades.
This assessment is different from previous USGS
assessments because digital files and databases are being
collected and stored in standardized formats, and being
analyzed using a Geographic Information System (GIS).
</purpose>
         <supplinf>
The Anderson coal bed outcrop theme represents a digital
line (arc) coverage compiled from published and
unpublished geologic mapping conducted by the U.S.
Geological Survey.  The outcrop represents either (1) the
trace of the exposed Anderson coal bed in outcrop, or (2)
the contact between the unburned Anderson coal bed and
adjacent clinker deposits where the Anderson coal bed
has burned.  Distribution of Anderson coal bed as depicted
in this coverage is generally representative of the coal
bed's distribution in the Decker coal field and nearby areas
of south-central Montana.  However, not all outcrops as
previously mapped in adjacent areas have been included,
and no information is presented for the Anderson coal bed
within the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Indian
Reservations.
The coverage is based on analog map data compiled at
scales of 24,000, 63,360, and 100,000. Because most of
the coverage was compiled at a 100,000 scale of
resolution, and it is strongly recommended that
user application of this coverage should not exceed this
level of detail.
The trace of the outcrop (or clinker contact)
was transferred from original maps (primarily folded paper
copies or composite photo-negative film reproductions) to
a base stable medium (mylar) and registered using
bounding control points in geographic (latitude and
longitude) coordinates. The mylars were then electronically
scanned to develop TIFF images and the images were
then rectified in ARC/INFO for use as templates for
subsequent on-screen digitizing of the outcrop line.
Individual line coverages from the different map sources
were then joined to form a single, composite line coverage
for the Anderson coal bed.  This line (arc) coverage was
then generalized using a weed tolerance of 30 meters to
reduce file size.  The generalized cover was then
converted to a shapefile for incorporation as a theme in the
ArcView project.
Although this coverage is generally representative of
previous geologic mapping pertaining to the Anderson coal
bed in the Decker coal field and surrounding areas, no
attempt was made to field check the final coverage for
verification of its accuracy and completeness.
