         <abstract>Aeromagnetic data were collected along flight lines by instruments in an
aircraft that recorded magnetic-field values and locations.  This dataset
presents latitude, longitude, altitude, and magnetic-field values.</abstract>
         <purpose>Aeromagnetic surveys are used for geophysical prospecting.  Some variations in
magnetic measurements are caused by rocks that contain significant amounts of
magnetic minerals (magnetite being the most common).  These anomalies reflect
variations in the amount and type of magnetic material and the shape and depth
of the body of rock. The features and patterns of aeromagnetic anomalies can
also be used to delineate details of subsurface geology including the locations
of buried faults and the thickness of surficial sedimentary rocks.</purpose>

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>The data in this file have been processed using various formulas and
methods that are not usually documented but that represent industry
standard practices for airborne data reduction.  For example, position
is listed as latitude and longitude, but these values were derived
from the raw navigation data depending on the system used.  (see notes
under horizontal accuracy). Line numbers were added to records, and
unusable data at flight-line ends were discarded (as aircraft slowed
and turned around). Separate recordings were correlated by time and
assigned to the correct location.
The exact accuracies of these processing steps may not be known.  They
are discussed in the sections on attribute or positional accuracies.</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>The data in this file were collected by a single contractor or group
who were responsible for collecting and processing the data.
The data from this survey were collected using the same instruments
(magnetometers, altimeters, navigational systems) throughout the survey
and were collected in a normal length of time with no long delays
between survey beginning and end.
Survey contracts specified the conditions and specifications under which
these data were collected.  Standard industry practices of the time
were followed in data collection and processing.</logic>
      <complete>There were numerous brief dropouts most of which were easily corrected by
interpolation.
Loss of data due to poor transmission, channel dropout, obvious spiking,
missing channels, and other obvious errors were replaced with the value
-9999.9, such as in the radar and barom channels. Sometimes channels were
added and filled with dummy values (-9999.9) to comply with the
established format.  Some records that had no usable data were deleted.
The month and year were stated in the published paper.  The first day of July
was used as the Julian day.</complete>
      <posacc>
         <horizpa>
            <horizpar>Flight Path Recovery
Horizontal positions of the survey aircraft used to collect data were
determined by reconciling down-looking photographs (recorded on
continuous-strip film) with topographic maps and orthophotoquadrangle
maps.  Fiducial numbers and marks, impressed on any paper strips that
were recording data or added to magnetic tape records, were included
as a function of time to further reconcile location with instrumentation.</horizpar>
         </horizpa>
         <vertacc>
            <vertaccr>The aircraft vertical position was determined using the navigational
positioning equipment on the aircraft, which were radar altimeter
and barometric altimeter.
Radar altimeters are estimated to have an error of 2-5% of the
altitude (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc., written communication).
Barometric altimeters are quite accurate, but are typically operated
in an uncorrected mode.  The diurnal variation in air pressure over
the course of a flight can produce a 50-100 ft error in the barometric
altimeter reading.  In addition, pressure microcells create short-
period air pressure changes equivalent to about 10 ft. under typical
conditions (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc., written communication)
This data set was collected as a draped survey having an average
terrain clearance of 1000 ft.  Because aircraft, especially airplanes,
cannot safely maintain a constant terrain clearance, error in vertical
position is introduced.</vertaccr>

            <procdesc>Conversion of measured values to geographic position and magnetic
values was performed by the contractor using industry standard
practices.
Details are found under Horizontal_Position_Accuracy_Report, and
Vertical_Position_Accuracy_Report
Unless noted, conversion processes were not reported to the USGS.
Unpublished products generated by the contractor included magnetic
tapes, a map of residual or total field magnetics, and perhaps some
written documentation.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>USGS reformatting of contractor data to standard format.
USGS personnel used the software package Oasis Montaj by
Geosoft, Inc., to read in the original contractor's data.
Latitude, longitude, altitude, and magnetic values were checked
for obvious errors or spikes and values of -9999.9 were given
where the value could not be reasonably corrected. Other errors
in the data were not corrected.  Horizontal positions were
converted to latitude and longitude if the original values were
UTM meters.  Elevations were converted from meters to feet
(1 m = 3.2808 ft).
Often the digital data did not contain date information and only the
month and year flown or just a starting date were stated in the
written documentation.  In these cases, the first day of the month
or the date the survey began was used as the Julian date and added
to the digital data.
Other information was added that was missing from the data file
but was recorded elsewhere.  The reformatted data were written in
the format described in the section on Digital_Transfer_Information.</procdesc>
