         <abstract>The diversion of freshwater from the Mississippi River is intended to mitigate saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico and to lessen the concomitant loss of wetland areas. Though effective, freshwater diversion can affect wildlife and habitat; therefore, prediversion and postdiversion data collections are necessary to identify effects. The Davis Pond freshwater diversion area is located between the Mississippi River and Bayou Lafourche and extends to Barataria Bay Basin, Louisiana. Results and interpretations from the prediversion biomonitoring done in 2001 - which included data on fish, eagles, and bivalves - are presented in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Scientific Investigations Report 2008-5067, "Davis Pond Freshwater Prediversion Biomonitoring Study: Freshwater Fisheries and Eagles." The postdiversion data generated approximately 6 years later from the sampling of fish whole bodies are presented here in this USGS Data Series. An accompanying log of postdiversion study site photographs was also produced in USGS Data Series 605, "Photographic Images Captured While Sampling for Bald Eagles near the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion Structure in Barataria Bay, Louisiana (2009-10).

This table presents the results of statistical analysis of variance of organic contaminants in fish sampled pre- and postdiversion of Davis Pond. Data collected consist of measurements of organic contaminants detected in largemouth bass, blue catfish and striped mullet samples collected in 2001 (prediversion) and 2007-2009 (6-8 years postdiversion). Total amounts of organic contaminants were compared using two-way and three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Organic contaminants tested for include aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorines (OCs), DDT, DDE, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). A two-site analysis was performed to compare levels of contamination in fish drawn from the Mississippi River, and those collected from all marsh sites (Lake Cataouatche, Bayou Couba, and Lake Salvador).</abstract>
         <purpose>The purpose of performing both prediversion and postdiversion monitoring was to obtain contaminants data to evaluate potential impacts of the operations of the Davis Pond freshwater diversion structure on fish, bivalves, and eagles in the downstream marsh area. </purpose>

         <attraccr>Data in this table were derived from statistical ANOVA tests performed on contaminants data collected in other tables of the "Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion Biomonitoring: Prediversion and Postdiversion Freshwater Fish Data," report, as well contaminants levels summarized in the earlier report, "Davis Pond Freshwater Prediversion Biomonitoring Study: Freshwater Fisheries and Eagles." Accuracy of the information depends upon the accuracy of the underlying collected data taken from these reports, as well as the statistical techniques used to analyze the information for this table. Laboratory services were performed and facilitated by Mississippi State Chemical Lab (prediversion) and TDI-Brooks International, Inc. (postdiversion).  

Standard quality-control and quality-assurance checks were performed by using duplicate samples, spiked samples, standard reference materials, and procedural blanks, and the limits of detection were defined as the Student's t for 99 percent confidence times the standard deviation of seven replicate measurements of the same low-level sample (Code of Federal Regulations, 2006). Statistical analyses were performed by trained scientists considered experts in this field.</attraccr>

      <complete>This study is a follow-up to measurements of contaminants in the Davis Pond area prediversion, in 2001. The prediversion study examined fish, bivalves, and eagles.  This postdiversion study only contains the results from fish sampling. 

The period symbol "." indicates no significant interaction between the analyzed factors.  Least squares means results are not spelled out in this table. Fields that contain "n.a." were not analyzed because valid comparisons could not be made due to differing detection levels between the labs used in the pre- and postdiversion analyses.</complete>

            <methdesc>To collect data for the contaminants testing at Davis Pond in both the prediversion (2001) and postdiversion (2007-2009) studies, fish were collected according to a final plan dated October 31, 1995 (U.S. Army Engineer District, 1995). Fish were collected by Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) personnel who used electroshock and gill and hoop nets from four sites: Lake Salvador, Bayou Couba, Lake Cataouatche, and the Mississippi River. Thirty-six fish were harvested, 12 fish from each of three species, with 3 individuals per species per site. Species included largemouth bass, blue catfish, and striped mullet. 

Sample collections were performed in accordance with protocols of the USGS Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends (BEST) Program (Schmitt and others, 1995; Schmitt, Blazer, and others, 1999; Smith and others 2002) and the National Water-Quality Assessment Program (Crawford and Luoma, 1993).</methdesc>

            <methdesc>Prediversion: After fish were collected for sampling, fish whole bodies were frozen at -20 degrees Celsius until analysis.
		
		Postdiversion: Samples were stored in precleaned jars and frozen (-20 degrees Celsius) until analysis. Automated extraction apparatus (ASE 200 Accelerated Solvent Extractor, Dionex, Sunnyvale, Calif.) was used with 0.5-15 g of tissue samples having been mixed with Hydromatrix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.). Using 100 percent dichloromethane inside stainless steel extraction cells at 100 degrees Celsius and 200 pounds per square inch (psi), the extracts were dissolved and were collected in 60-milliliter (mL) glass vials and concentrated to 1-3 mL by using an evaporative solvent reduction apparatus (water bath or TurboVap II Evaporation System, Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, Mass.). Sample aliquots were weighed for determining percentage of lipids, and the remaining portions were processed through a clean-up column (activated silica gel and alumina) and high-performance liquid chromatography to minimize matrix interference. Extracts concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 mL were submitted for determination of aliphatic, aromatic, and chlorinated hydrocarbons.</methdesc>

            <methdesc>Prediversion: To test for organic contaminants in 2001, analyses for AHs and PAHs were done by first digesting tissue with potassium hydroxide, then neutralizing, and then reconstituting in petroleum ether before transfer to a silica gel chromatography column. Eluates of AH and PAH residues were separated by eluting aliphatics from the column with petroleum ether followed by elution of aromatics with methylene chloride with petroleum ether mixture and then methylene chloride. This eluate was concentrated for quantification by capillary column, flame ionization gas chromatography (Mississippi State Chemical Laboratory [MSCL] standard operating procedure [SOP] 1.265). The aromatic hydrocarbon fraction was reconstituted in methylene chloride and quantified by gas chromatographymass spectroscopy (MSCL SOP 1.276). Separation of OC pesticides and PCBs was done on a silicic acid chromatographic column following analysis by megabore column electron capture gas chromatography (MSCL SOP 1.267). Total PCBs were calculated by adding the sum of Aroclors 1242, 1248, 1254, and 1260.
		
Postdiversion:
"Aliphatic Hydrocarbon Determination by Gas Chromatography/Flame Ionization Detection (GC/FID)"
Target analytes were analyzed by using a Hewlett Packard (HP) model 5890 Series II Gas Chromatograph with a Flame Ionization Detector (Hewlett Packard Company, Palo Alto, Calif.) operated in a splitless mode. An HP-1MS capillary column (30-m x 0.25-mm inner diameter [ID] and 0.25-mm film thickness) was used to resolve peaks. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/minute (min). The temperature of the injection port was 300 degrees Celsius, and transfer line was 300 degrees Celsius. The initial oven temperature was 60 degrees Celsius, and the ramp rate was 12 degrees Celsius/min to a final oven temperature of 180 degrees Celsius. Normal alkanes with 10-34 carbons and the isoprenoids pristine and phytane were determined by using this procedure.

"Aromatic Hydrocarbon Determination by Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM)-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)"
Quantitation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated homologues was done with a HP model 5890 GC and model 5972 MS operated in SIM by using a capillary column. The GC was operated in splitless mode, and the capillary column was an HP-5 ms (60-m x 0.25-mm ID and 0.25-mm film thickness) (Agilent Technologies). The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The temperature of the injection port was 300 degrees Celsius, and transfer line was 290 degrees Celsius. The mass spectrometer scanned from 35 to 500 atomic mass units (amu) per second or less by utilizing 70 volts of electron energy in electron impact ionization mode. The relative peak heights of the primary mass ion compared to the confirmation or secondary mass ion fell within 30 percent of the relative intensities of these masses in a reference mass spectrum.

"Organochlorine Determination by Gas Chromatography/Electron Capture Detection (ECD)"
Quantitation was performed on an HP model 5890 GC equipped with an ECD. Between 1 and 5 mL of sample was injected by using an HP model 7673A autosampler. The primary capillary column was a J&amp;W DB-5 (30-m x 24-mm ID and 0.25-mm film thickness). The second column, a confirmation column, was a J&amp;W DB-17HT (30-m x 0.25-mm ID and 0.15-mm film thickness). The inlet system was splitless, and the carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. For the analysis of standard halogenated hydrocarbons, the temperature of the injection port was 275 degrees Celsius, and the detector was 325 degrees Celsius. The initial oven temperature was 100 degrees Celsius with a hold time of 1 min. The ramp rate was 5 degrees Celsius/min to 140 degrees Celsius with a hold time of 1 min, followed by a ramp rate of 1.5 degrees Celsius/min to 250 degrees Celsius with a hold time of 1 min and a ramp rate of 10 degrees Celsius/min to 300 degrees Celsius with a final hold time of 5 min.

Additional column chromatography is required to separate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from toxaphene/pesticides and planar PCBs. An aliquot of the extract prior to clean-up with high-performance liquid chromatography was processed through a 3 percent deactivated silica gel column packed in dichloromethane, which was then flushed with pentane. The sample extract was transferred to the top of the column and flushed with 100 mL of pentane; this fraction contained PCBs and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs). This fraction was further processed by column chromatography packed with activated carbon/Celite (1:19 and 5 percent by weight) (World Minerals Inc., Santa Barbara, Calif.) and flushing with 1:4 dichloromethane/cyclohexane mixture. The instrument was operated in the splitless mode with helium as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The temperature of the injection port was 275 degrees Celsius, and the detector was 325 degrees Celsius. The initial oven temperature was 100 degrees Celsius, held for 1 min. The ramp rate was 10 degrees Celsius/min to 150 degrees Celsius, followed by a ramp rate of 6.0 degrees Celsius/min to 270 degrees Celsius with a hold time of 3 min.

The retention time of sample analytes fell within 15 seconds of the retention time of analytes in a calibration standard or retention index solutions. The levels of aroclor and toxaphene were determined by using retention index solutions of both complex mixtures. Aroclor were determined in a similar method to that described by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</methdesc>

      <overview>
         <eaover>ANOVA tests were performed on the organic contaminants data collected. ANOVA analyzes variance to determine if a result is likely to be random or attributable to some causative factor. This table displays the likelihood of the observed variance in chemical contaminations arising by chance, expressed as p (probability) values.  Low values indicate a significant result with a low probability of occurring randomly. Least squares means results are not spelled out in this table.

Abbreviations:  
Spp = species
Cat = blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus)
Mul= striped mullet (Mugil cephalus)
Lmb= largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)
Mi= Mississippi River
Other = Lake Salvador, Lake Cataouatche, and Bayou Couba
DDT= dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
DDE= dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene
Dot symbol (.)=  indicates no significant interaction
Asterisk symbol (*)= indicates interaction</eaover>
