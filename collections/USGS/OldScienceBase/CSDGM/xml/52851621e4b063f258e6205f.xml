         <abstract>The diversion of freshwater from the Mississippi River is intended to mitigate saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico and to lessen the concomitant loss of wetland areas. Though effective, freshwater diversion can affect wildlife and habitat; therefore, prediversion and postdiversion data collections are necessary to identify effects. The Davis Pond freshwater diversion area is located between the Mississippi River and Bayou Lafourche and extends to Barataria Bay Basin, Louisiana. Results and interpretations from the prediversion biomonitoring done in 2001 - which included data on fish, eagles, and bivalves - are presented in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Scientific Investigations Report 2008-5067, "Davis Pond Freshwater Prediversion Biomonitoring Study: Freshwater Fisheries and Eagles." The postdiversion data generated approximately 6 years later from the sampling of fish whole bodies are presented here in this USGS Data Series. An accompanying log of postdiversion study site photographs was also produced in USGS Data Series 605, "Photographic Images Captured While Sampling for Bald Eagles near the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion Structure in Barataria Bay, Louisiana (2009-10).

This table presents the results of statistical analysis of variance of inorganic contaminants in fish sampled pre- and postdiversion of Davis Pond. Data collected consist of measurements of inorganic contaminants detected in largemouth bass, blue catfish and striped mullet samples collected in 2001 (prediversion) and 2007-2009 (6-8 years postdiversion). Total amounts of inorganic contaminants were compared using two-way and three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Inorganic contaminants tested for include aluminum, arsenic, barium, boron, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel, selenium, strontium, vanadium, and zinc. A two-site analysis was performed to compare levels of contamination in fish drawn from the Mississippi River, and those collected from all marsh sites (Lake Cataouatche, Bayou Couba, and Lake Salvador).</abstract>
         <purpose>The purpose of performing both prediversion and postdiversion monitoring was to obtain contaminants data to evaluate potential impacts of the operations of the Davis Pond freshwater diversion structure on fish, bivalves, and eagles in the downstream marsh area. </purpose>

         <attraccr>Data in this table were derived from statistical ANOVA tests performed on contaminants data collected in other tables of the "Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion Biomonitoring: Prediversion and Postdiversion Freshwater Fish Data," report, as well contaminants levels summarized in the earlier report, "Davis Pond Freshwater Prediversion Biomonitoring Study: Freshwater Fisheries and Eagles." Accuracy of the information depends upon the accuracy of the underlying collected data taken from these reports, as well as the statistical techniques used to analyze the information for this table. Laboratory services were performed and facilitated by the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG) at Texas A&amp;M (prediversion) and Laboratory &amp; Environmental Testing, Inc. (postdiversion). 

Standard quality-control and quality-assurance checks were performed by using duplicate samples, spiked samples, standard reference materials, and procedural blanks, and the limits of detection were defined as the Student's t for 99 percent confidence times the standard deviation of seven replicate measurements of the same low-level sample (Code of Federal Regulations, 2006). Statistical analyses were performed by trained scientists considered experts in this field.</attraccr>

      <complete>This study is a follow-up to measurements of contaminants in the Davis Pond area prediversion, in 2001. The prediversion study examined fish, bivalves, and eagles.  This postdiversion study only contains the results from fish sampling. 

The period symbol "." indicates no significant interaction between the analyzed factors.  Least squares means results are not spelled out in this table. Fields that contain "n.a." were not analyzed because valid comparisons could not be made due to differing detection levels between the labs used in the pre- and postdiversion analyses.</complete>

            <methdesc>To collect data for the contaminants testing at Davis Pond in both the prediversion (2001) and postdiversion (2007-2009) studies, fish were collected according to a final plan dated October 31, 1995 (U.S. Army Engineer District, 1995). Fish were collected by Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) personnel who used electroshock and gill and hoop nets from four sites: Lake Salvador, Bayou Couba, Lake Cataouatche, and the Mississippi River. Thirty-six fish were harvested, 12 fish from each of three species, with 3 individuals per species per site. Species included largemouth bass, blue catfish, and striped mullet. 

Sample collections were performed in accordance with protocols of the USGS Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends (BEST) Program (Schmitt and others, 1995; Schmitt, Blazer, and others, 1999; Smith and others 2002) and the National Water-Quality Assessment Program (Crawford and Luoma, 1993).</methdesc>

            <methdesc>During the Davis Pond pre-diversion lab testing, analysis for metals followed procedures contained in
SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) of the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (tissue digestion SOPs 0006 and 9408 and analysis SOPs 9409 and 9802). For trace metals analyses, frozen samples were thawed, subsamples removed for percent dry weight and trace metals analyses, and subsamples were freeze dried. Tissues were macerated by using a Teflon (DupontTM) spatula, and the freeze-dried subsamples were ground to a fine powder, weighed to 0.1 mg, and transferred into a 50- mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. Concentrated sulfuric acid (2.5 mL) was added and vortexed, and then concentrated nitric acid (1.5 mL) was added and vortexed. The sample tube was capped loosely and then heated in a water bath at 90 degrees Celsius to 95 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. After cooling, distilled deionized water (10 mL) was added and vortexed, and then 5 percent (by weight) potassium permanganate (10 mL) and 5 percent (by weight) potassium persulfate (5 mL) were added to each tube. The tube was vortexed, capped tightly, and left overnight at room temperature (more than 12 hours). A sodium chloride/ hydroxylamine sulfate solution (5 mL) was added to reduce excess permanganate, and the digestate was brought to a final volume of 35 mL with deionized water prior to analysis. The tube was mixed until the manganese oxide particles were dissolved, and then samples were analyzed by using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Geochemical and Environmental Research Group SOP 006).

During Davis Pond postdiversion contaminants testing, quantitation of metals was done according to the methods developed and accepted by U.S. Department of the Interior and generally accord with EPA Methods 200.7 (Martin and others, 1994) and 200.8 (Creed and others, 1994). For digestion, the normal sample weight was 0.500 g dw, with 5.0 mL trace metal grade nitric acid and 1 mL of high purity hydrogen peroxide. Samples were heated to 180 degrees Celsius, and after cooling, they were diluted to 50.0 mL. For digestion for arsenic and selenium, magnesium nitrate dry ash was used, and the normal sample weight was 0.500 g dw, with 10 mL trace metal grade nitric acid, 2 mL of trace metal grade hydrogen chloride (HCl), and 10 mL 40 percent magnesium nitrate hydrate in a 100 mL Pyrex (Corning Incorporated) beaker. Samples were refluxed overnight at 70 to 80 degrees Celsius and then heated to dryness and placed in a muffle furnace and ramped at 1 degree Celsius/min to 500 degrees Celsius and held for 1 h. After addition of 10 mL 50 percent HCl, samples were refluxed on a hot plate for 1 h, cooled, and diluted to 50 mL. Instrumentation for analyses included an Optima 7300 DV ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) and atomic absorption by AAnalyst 600 with or without a FIA S1000 (Perkin Elmer).

For determination of methylmercury, the procedure was modified for tissue and based on EPA Method 1630 (2001). Methylmercury was defined as all methylmercury forms and species found in the digestate. Samples were digested with methanol and potassium hydroxide and then ethylated prior to analysis with a Model III cold-vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometer (Brooks Rand Labs, Seattle, Wash.) (EPA, 2001).</methdesc>

      <overview>
         <eaover>ANOVA tests were performed on the inorganic contaminants data collected. ANOVA analyzes variance to determine if a result is likely to be random or attributable to some causative factor. This table displays the likelihood of the observed variance in chemical contaminations arising by chance, expressed as p (probability) values.  Low values indicate a significant result with a low probability of occurring randomly. Least squares means results are not spelled out in this table.  

Abbreviations:  
Spp = species
Cat = blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus)
Mul= striped mullet (Mugil cephalus)
Lmb= largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)
Mi= Mississippi River
Other = Lake Salvador, Lake Cataouatche, and Bayou Couba
Dot symbol (.)=  indicates no significant interaction
Asterisk symbol (*)= indicates interaction</eaover>
