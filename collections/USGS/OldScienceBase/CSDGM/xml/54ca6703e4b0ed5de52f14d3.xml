         <abstract>Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983  NAD83).The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255. The standard, uncompressed gray scale DOQ format contains an ASCII header followed by a series  of 8-bit image data lines.  The keyword-based, ASCII header may vary in the number of data entries.  The header is affixed to the beginning of the image and is composed of strings of 80 characters with an asterisk (*) as character 79 and an invisible newline character as character 80. Each keyword string contains information for either identification, display, or registration of the image. Additional strings of blanks are added to the header so that the length of a header line equals the number of bytes in a line of image data.  The header line will be equal in length to the length of an image line.  If the sum of the byte count of the header is less than the sample count of one DOQ image line, then the remainder of the header is padded with the  requisite number of 80 character blank entries, each terminated with an asterisk and newline character.</abstract>
         <purpose>DOQs serve a variety of purposes, from interim maps to field references for Earth science investigations and analysis.
The DOQ is useful as a layer of a geographic information system and as a tool for revision of digital line graphs and
topographic maps.

         <attraccr> Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the photo image. Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during a mosaicing process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images to improve their tone.

      <logic>All DOQ header data and image file sizes are validated by  Tape Validation System (TVS) software prior to archiving in the Sales Data Base. This validation procedure assures correct physical format and field values for header record elements. Logical relationships between header record elements are tested. </logic>
      <complete>All DOQ images are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacement exists in the iimage area or in overedge coverage. The DOQ images may be derived by mosaicking multiple images, in order to insure complete coverage. All DOQs are cloud free. Some clouds may, very infrequently, be encountered only in the overedge coverage. Source photography is leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions. Void areas may exist, having a radiometric value of zero and appearing black. These voids are areas for which no photographic source is available or are the result of image transformation from other planimetric systems to the UTM projection. In the latter case, the void sliver areas are on the outside edges of the overedge area. The data set field content of each DOQ header record element is validated to assure completeness prior to archiving in the Sales Data Base.

            <procdesc>To produce a DOQ requires (1) a minimum of three ground positions that can be identified on the photograph to be rectified, (2) camera calibration parameters, such as the calibrated focal length and the coordinates of the camera fiducials, (3) a digital elevation model (DEM), and (4) a digital image produced by scanning an aerial photograph with a precise, high-resolution scanner.The digital image is rectified to generate an orthophoto by processing requirements 1 through 3 above for each image picture element (pixel), using rigorous photogrammetric equations on a computer. The finished product is a spatially accurate image with planimetric features represented in their true geographic positions.
