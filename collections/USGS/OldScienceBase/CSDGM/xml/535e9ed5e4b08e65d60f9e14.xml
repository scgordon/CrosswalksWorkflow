      <descript>
         <abstract>A cells polygon feature class was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to illustrate the degree of exploration, type of production, and distribution of production in the State of Ohio.  Each cell represents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells are coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are predominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and gas-producing, or the type of production of the wells located within the cell is unknown or dry.  The well information was acquired from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological Survey in a Geographic Information System (GIS) data layer that contains all of the locatable oil and gas wells in Ohio.  Cells were developed as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying proprietary well data.  No proprietary data are displayed or included in the cell maps.  The data are current as of 2004.</abstract>
         <purpose>This Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset was created to display present and past oil and gas production in the United States, as well as the location and intensity of exploratory drilling outside producing areas.  This map compilation is an updated version of the USGS map that was published by Mast and others (1998). This product differs from other oil and gas maps of the United States in the following ways:  (1) the oil and gas data sources are current as of 2004 through 2006,  (2) base cartographic reference data are included, using the USGS National Map and a World Shaded Relief map service from the ESRI geography network,  (3) an internet map service is available online,  (4) Alaska oil and gas data are included.
			
To construct this map, digital data were used from more than 3 million wells in IHS Inc.'s PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data on CD-ROM, current through 10/1/2005.  In some areas, the PI/Dwights data tend not to be complete, particularly for pre-1920 production. IHS data was supplemented with state wells databases for Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Illinois, and Ohio, (current as of 2004 to 2006).</purpose>

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>The accuracy of the wells is unknown.  But extensive quality control tests were conducted from the time of the release of the data set in 1997 up to today.

The cell locations and cell attributes were visually compared to the hard-copy map:  Mast, R.F., Root, D.H., Williams, L.P., Beeman, W.R., and Barnett, D.L., 1998, Areas of historical oil and gas exploration and production in the conterminous United States: U.S. Geological Survey Oil and Gas Investigations Map I-2582, 1 sheet; http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/oilgas/noga/oilgasmap.htm and http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1995/ofr-95-0075-c/</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>The accuracy of the cells, as created by the Arc Macro Language (AML) program of L.R.H. Biewick, S. Weiler and C.C. Skinner, depends upon the accuracy of the locatable oil and gas wells GIS data layer from the Ohio Division of Geological Survey. For the USGS map compilation showing Areas of Historical Oil and Gas Exploration and Production in the United States, the assumption was made that the data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Geographic Information Management Systems were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.</logic>
      <complete>The cells were defined using the 2004 well data in the Ohio Department of Natural Resources oil and gas wells GIS data set. It is not known how many wells are missing from the 2004 version, which contains over 220,000 wells, but anywhere from 267,000 to over 300,000 wells have been drilled in Ohio.</complete>
      <posacc>
         <horizpa>
            <horizpar>A visual comparison was made using a sampling of cell locations and cell attributes with well locations and attributes. The horizontal positional accuracy of the Ohio oil and gas well locations is estimated to be ± 50 feet.</horizpar>

            <procdesc>Oil and gas well data for the State of Ohio were run through an Arc Macro Language (AML) program written by L.R.H. Biewick, S. Weiler, and C.C. Skinner. This program aggregated and converted the 2004 Ohio oil and gas well data into quarter-mile cells and latitude-longitude points that represent the center-points of the quarter-mile cells.  The Ohio cells were then assigned an attribute based on the type of production of the wells located within the cell. Used the WL_SYMBOL attribute to populate wellsymb and ultimately cellsymb, as follows:

Oil

WELLR = Oil well.
WELLT = Plugged oil well.
WELLU = Oil well with gas show.
WELLX = Plugged oil well with gas show.
WDHPR = Plugged well that produced oil from two or more horizons.
WDHPU = Plugged well that produced oil with a gas show from two or more horizons.
WEDHR = Well producing oil from two or more horizons.
WEDHU = Well producing oil with a gas show from two or more horizons.

Gas

WDHPN = Plugged well that produced gas with a oil show from two or more horizons.
WDHPS = Plugged well that produced gas from two or more horizons.
WEDHN = Well producing gas with a show of oil from two or more horizons.
WEDHS = Well producing gas from two or more horizons.
WELLF = Plugged gas well.
WELLN = Gas well with oil show.
WELLS = Gas well.
WELPN = Plugged gas well with oil show.

Both oil and gas

WELLV = Oil and gas well.
WELLY = Plugged oil and gas well.
WELLZ = Well producing oil and gas from two or more horizons.
WELPZ = Plugged well that produced oil and gas from two or more horizons.

Dry or Unknown

STAR  = Unknown status.
WELLE = Gas show.
WELLG = dry hole oil and gas show.
WELLJ = plugged dry hole oil and gas show.
WELLK = Dry hole with gas show.
WELLL = Dry hole with oil show.
WELLM = Dry hole with oil and gas show.
WELLO = Oil show.
WELLW = Dry hole.
WELOS = lost hole
