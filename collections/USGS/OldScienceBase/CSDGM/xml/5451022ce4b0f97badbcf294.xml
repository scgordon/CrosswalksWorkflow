         <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) has obtained        historical photography of the Upper Mississippi River, collected by the Corps of Engineers. The                    U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) Upper Mississippi National Wildlife and Fish Refuge contracted the Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) to scan and georeference the 1947 images for lower Pool 8, to create reference images for use in geographic information system (GIS).  These data are also distributed through the UMESC Web site, so others can also access the data.</abstract>
         <purpose>
The Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center
administers the Long Term Resource Monitoring
Program (LTRMP), authorized under the Water
Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law
99-662).  The mission of the LTRMP is to provide
decision-makers with information to maintain the
Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) as a viable
large river ecosystem given its multiple-use
character.  The long-term goals of the Program are
to understand the system, determine resource
trends and impacts, develop management
alternatives, manage information, and develop
useful products.  The collection and distribution
of high-resolution aerial photography aids the
Center in meeting these goals.
</purpose>
         <supplinf>
To make the data easier to download, the photo
mosaic has been compressed and is being served as
a georeferenced MrSid image.  A software program
that contains MrSid image support or a MrSid image
viewer is required to view these data.  A free
image viewer capable of subsetting, resampling,
and exporting the compressed image to
georeferenced TIFF image (a .tif image and a .tfw
world file) is available at
http://www.lizardtech.com/.  The data are stored
in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
projection, zone 15.  Two datum options are
available, North American Datum 1927 (NAD27) and
North American Datum 1983 (NAD83).

basemap used to register the photos was a digital

GIS interns placed each photograph in a scanner
with the photo's most northerly side directed
upwards.  The photos were scanned using a 200 dots
per inch (dpi) image resolution, and the files
were saved as TIFF images.  The photo image was
assigned a name that described the photo's (1)
flight line, (2) photo number, (3) the year in
which the photo was collected, and (4) a
distinction between true color and color infrared.

in all cases was either 1:12,000 DOQ images or
1:24,000 DRG  data.  Root mean square (RMS) errors
under 7.0 were desired for all areas.
