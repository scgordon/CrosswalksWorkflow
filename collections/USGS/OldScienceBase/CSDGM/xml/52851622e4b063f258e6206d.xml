         <abstract>This dataset consists of a map depicting the landcover of the Natchez Trace Parkway. The mapping output was created using mosaiced color infrared aerial photography of the Parkway. The map shows the distribution of 18 landcover classes based on the National Vegetation Classification Standard.  Ground-based vegetation classification was provided by the National Park Service (NPS). The mapping output delineates grasses, road-developed areas, scrub-shrub, shrubland, plantation, water bodies, areas of white oak, oak, pine-oak, pine-cedar, pine-sweetgum, sweetgum (including sweetgum-oak), scattered trees, swamp forest, irregular classes, aquatic vegetation, invasive species, canopy gaps, and clouds.

Total mapped area includes a 100 m buffer outside the park boundary. 235 digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles (DOQQs) were required to cover the entire 715 km long Parkway. For ease of use, the DOQQs were grouped into 11 mosaics, each covering a section of the Parkway. At the request of the NPS, each mosaic was divided into ten tiles to allow for efficient loading on less robust computers.</abstract>
         <purpose>The purpose of this dataset is to provide an accurate depiction of the Natchez Trace Parkway landscape using the National Vegetation Classification Standard. This map is part of the USGS-NPS Vegetation Characterization Program, a cooperative effort by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Park Service (NPS), to classify, describe, and map vegetation communities in more than 280 national park units across the United States. This landmark program is both the first to provide national-scale descriptions of vegetation for a Federal agency and the first to create national vegetation standards for its data products. The vegetation mapping program is an important part of the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program, a long-term effort to develop baseline data for all national park units that have a natural resource component.

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>National Vegetation Classification data compiled by the National Park Service (NPS) at ground sites throughout the Natchez Trace Parkway were used to assign the class descriptors in the landcover classifications.  A minimum of 30 independent accuracy assessment points per landcover was desired; however, this was not reached for all landcover classes.  Further, ground sites were often sparse in regions of the Parkway.  The lack of an adequate number of sites per class and the sparseness of the sites prevented the creation of two assessment sets; one for assigning class and one for accuracy assessment.  Because of this, classification accuracy assessments used the same NPS data to assign class descriptors.  The overall accuracy of the landcover classes was estimated to be 74%.</attraccr>

            <procdesc>An 11 m by 25 m (average) spectral filter was applied to the DOQQs to produce a scale comparable to the 20 m by 50 m ground-plot size used by the National Park Service. This filter was applied to each of the 11 mosaic sections of the Parkway imagery. The filter minimized unwanted canopy variability (irregularly illuminated tree crowns and canopy gaps and associated shadowing) and maximized forest-stand identification.</procdesc>

         <procstep>
            <procdesc>An unsupervised classification (accomplished numerically and impartially with little human input) was performed on the eleven mosaic sections of the Parkway. This process involved aggregating the pixels into spectral groupings, or clusters, based solely on the spectral distribution present in the image. The analyst then determined the landcover identity of these spectral groups by associating the classified image data with ground reference data from the National Park Service classification and notes from field reconnaissance missions.

         <procstep>
            <procdesc>The final mapping of the Parkway involved both machine processes (unsupervised classification) and human analysis (supervised classification).  As a first step, shadows, edge and gap, were isolated and replaced on the map. Steps were taken to minimize the abrupt changes that occur between mosaiced orthophotos. Cutlines were compensated for by creating masks at the borders between orthophotos and applying classification algorithms only in the masked areas. 

The modified data were classified using an unsupervised classification algorithm. Progressive clustering techniques were used to separate and group clusters with mixed identities until all possible groups had been identified.  The leftover clusters were labeled irregular classes on the map legend.  Once all possible spectrally distinct classes had been identified, the final set of classes was migrated to the next adjacent mosaic section. A single signature migration was not applied from one end of the Parkway to the other; however, a mixture of progressive mapping classifications and signature migrations were applied throughout the Parkway.

In a continued effort to generate a map product conforming to requests by the National Park Service, different filters were applied to the mapping output in order to reduce mapping artifacts, such as isolated pixel groups and ribbons. As a final step, an assessment of mapping accuracy was completed to provide an overall estimate of mapping performance. Field site observations were compared to the generated landcover map and the accuracy reported in contingency tables. Lastly, mapping outputs were then divided into 10 tiles per mosaic section at the request of the National Park Service.
