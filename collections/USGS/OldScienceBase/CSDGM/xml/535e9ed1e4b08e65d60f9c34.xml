This ArcView shapefile contains a point representation of
coal quality samples. This theme was created
specifically for the National Coal Resources Assessment in
the Northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains Region.
</abstract>
         <purpose>
The Nation's coal resources are being assessed by the
USGS.  This assessment identifies and characterizes
the coal beds and coal zones that will provide the
bulk of the Nation's coal-derived energy during the
next few decades.  This assessment is different from
previous USGS assessments because digital files
and databases are being collected and stored in
standardized formats, and being analyzed using a
Geographic Information System (GIS).

The following paragraphs describe the process that the
Northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains team utilized
to produce summary tables of coal quality for the region.
All available data was collected, from U.S. Geological
Survey coal quality (USCHEM) unpublished database,
Bragg and others (1994), and proprietary source(s) .
Summary data for 18 variables were calculated for the
each assessed basin and for each coal zone when
appropriate.  However, some coal quality data in this study
are proprietary.  Both proprietary and public data are used
in the summary data tables, but only public data is shown
on location maps and other graphical displays.  A common
problem in statistical summaries of trace-element data
arises when element values are below the limits of
detection.  This results in a censored distribution.  To
compute unbiased estimates of censored data for the
elements in this table, we adopted the protocol of reducing
all "less than" values by 50 percent to generate a real
value for these data.  Summary statistics of range (minimum
and maximum value) and arithmetic means were generated
using the modified data.  Moisture values are reported on
an as-received basis (American Society for Testing and
Materials, 1994b, designation D3180-89).  Because no
equilibrium moisture values are available for this report,
apparent ranks can not reliably be determined.
Between 1974 and 1994, the U.S. Geological Survey
analyzed samples of coal for contents of major-, minor-, and
trace elements.  Prior to performing the analyses, most of
the coal samples were dried at room temperature and
humidity for as much as 80 hours.  Some samples,
however, may have only been dried enough to allow
grinding (to less than 100 mesh).  Moisture content in the
samples is unknown, although moisture contents were
probably similar to that which would remain after air-dry loss
determination (American Society for Testing and Materials
ASTM Standards, 1994c, designation D3302-91). Since
the actual moisture content of the samples analyzed
between 1974 and 1994 is unknown, the elemental
analysis of the samples cannot be converted to any other
moisture basis.  In addition, these analyses can only
provide an approximation of load factors (such as, pounds
of mercury per trillion Btu).
For the following illustrations of public data, 17 variables of
the total 18 variables color keyed to show the relative
values of each variable, however heat value will not be
shown.  When more than one analysis was available per
location, the analytical values were weight averaged on
coal sample thickness.  For ash and total sulfur, the values
are keyed to blue for low, yellow for medium, and red for
high, following the guidelines established in U.S.
Geological Survey Circular 891 (Wood and others, 1983).
For heat value (Btu/lb) and moist, mineral-matter-free Btu
(apparent rank), the apparent rank designations
established by American Society for Testing and Materials,
(1994a), designation D388-92a were utilized.  For lb of SO2
per million Btu, values are keyed according to the
Environmental Protection Agency's Phase I (yellow), Phase
II (blue), and non-compliant (red) limits for sulfur emission
from coal-fired power plants (Environmental Protection
Agency, 1996).  No guidelines have been established for
the elements of environmental concern (also referred to as
"hazardous air pollutants" or "HAPs").  Analytical values
for these elements are color keyed based on the following
(1) each element of environmental concern
was ranked from the lowest to highest value for all data in
the Northern Rockies and Great Plains region and (2)
quartiles were established for each element such that the
color blue represents those values that are less than the
.25 quartile (also known as the lower quartile or the 25th
percentile), the color yellow represents those values that
are within the .25 to .75 quartiles (two quartiles
representing 50 percent of the values or between the 25th
to 75th percentile), and the color red represents those
values that are in the upper .25 quartile (or greater than the
75th percentile).

Pounds of sulfur dioxide per million British thermal units
(lbSO2/MBtu) is a theoretical analysis calculated from
basic analytical data for determining the quantity of sulfur in
coal, expressed in  pounds of SO2  when sufficient coal
had been incinerated to produce 1 million Btu and the
sulfur in the coal converted  to sulfur dioxide.  Used in
determining sulfur emission from coal-fired power plants.

A common problem in statistical summaries of trace-element data arises when element value from sample analysis is below the limits of detection.  This results in a censored distribution.  To compute unbiased estimates of these censored data for elements in the table, we adopted the protocol of reducing all "less than" values by 50 percent to generate  real values for these data.</attrdef>

            <attrdef>Theoretical ranking of Nickel, a trace element of environmental concern, calculated from basic analytical data for the purpose of  classification into low-, medium-, or high-concentration categories.  This classification is based on the following parameters: (1) each element of environmental concern was ranked from the lowest to highest value for all data in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains region and (2) quartiles were established for each element such that low represents those values that are less than the .25 quartile (also known as the lower quartile or the 25th percentile), medium represents those values that are within the .25 to .75 quartiles (two quartiles representing 50 percent of the values or between the 25th and 75th percentile), and high represents those values that are in the upper .25 quartile (or greater than the 75th percentile).</attrdef>
