         <abstract>The High Plains aquifer extends from south of 32 degrees to almost 44 degrees north latitude and from 96 degrees 30 minutes to 104 degrees west longitude. The aquifer underlies about 175,000 square miles in parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. This dataset consists of a raster of water-level changes for the High Plains aquifer, predevelopment (about 1950) to 2013. This digital dataset was created using water-level measurements from 3,349 wells measured in both the predevelopment period (about 1950) and in 2013 and using other published information on water-level change in areas with few water-level measurements. The map was reviewed for consistency with the relevant data at a scale of 1:1,000,000.</abstract>
         <purpose>This dataset was created to document water-level changes in the High Plains aquifer from predevelopment (about 1950) to 2013.</purpose>
         <supplinf>This raster dataset is associated with the U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report (SIR 2014-5218, McGuire, 2014), which describes the methods used to generate this raster dataset.</supplinf>

         <attraccr>The water-level-change data used as the basis for this dataset were computed primarily from water levels measured in wells during both the predevelopment period and in 2013 and from other published data.</attraccr>
         <qattracc>
            <attraccv>variable</attraccv>
            <attracce>The precision of the water-level measurements is estimated to be 0.01 feet (ft), if there is not oil in the well. The accuracy of the water-level measurements can be affected by many factors; if there is oil on the surface of the water, the error in the water-level measurement could be as much as 5 ft, depending on the depth of the oil. 
				The accuracy of the water-level change value for a given cell is dependent on the proximity of cell to measured wells. The average, median, and maximum distance between wells, which were measured in predevelopment and in 2013, is 3.2 miles, 2.7 miles, and 20.1 miles, respectively. In the area of water-level changes from a decline of 5 ft to a rise of 5 ft, the cell's water-level change value was set to zero because of uncertainty in the interpolation of water-level changes less than 5 ft, especially in areas with few measured wells.</attracce>

            <horizpar>The accuracy of the water-level change value for a given cell is dependent on the proximity of cell to measured wells. The average, median, and maximum distance between wells, which were measured in predevelopment and in 2013, is 3.2 miles, 2.7 miles, and 20.1 miles, respectively. The interpolation process uses the water-level change value from measured wells and other supporting data. For cells collocated with measured well(s), the interpolation process results in cell values that are generally similar to, but commonly not equal to, the calculated values for the measured well(s).</horizpar>

            <procdesc>The raster output from the initial run of Esri Arc/Info Version 10.0 TOPOGRID was contoured using the Esri Arc/Info Version 10.0 CONTOUR command. The contour intervals were less than -150 ft, -150 to -100 ft, -100 to -50 ft, -50 to -25 ft, -25 to -10 ft, -10 to -5 ft, -5 to +5 ft, 5 to 10 ft, 10 to 25 ft, and greater than 50 ft.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>A map of the contours of water-level change, predevelopment to 2013, was prepared with the primary and supplemental point datasets presented for a manual review and revision of the contours particularly in areas where few wells had the applicable water-level measurements. The modified contours were converted to polygons, using the Esri Arc/Info Version 10.0 BUILD command, each polygon was populated with the contour range, and the polygons were converted into two rasters using the Esri Arc/Info Version 10.0 POLYGRID command. One raster, r1_pd13max, was populated with the lowest (for polygons of declines) or highest (for polygons of rises) value of the polygon range, that is, -149.99 for the polygon of declines less than or equal to -100 ft and greater than -150 ft, and 49.99 for the polygons of rises greater than or equal to 25 ft and less than 50 ft. The second raster, r2_pd13min, was populated with the highest (for polygons of declines) or lowest (for polygons of rises) value of the polygon range, that is -100.01 for the polygon of declines less than or equal to -100 ft and greater than -150 ft, and 25.01 ft for the polygons of rises greater than or equal to 25 ft and less than 50 ft. </procdesc>

            <procdesc>The Esri Arc/Info Version 10.0 TOPOGRID command was used to generate a revised raster of water-level change from predevelopment to 2013 using as inputs the calculated value deltapd_13 for each well measured in predevelopment and 2013 (Kansas Geological Survey, 2014; Texas Water Development Board, 2014; U.S. Geological Survey, 2014), the aquifer boundary (Qi, 2010), and, to guide water-level contours in areas with few wells, the manually modified contours of water-level change, predevelopment to 2013. TOPOGRID was run with (1) the boundary equal to the aquifer outer boundary; (2) the point file of the aquifer boundary, aq_only_pt, using attribute field beginval; (3) the point file hp_pd13pts, attribute field deltapd_13; (4) the contour file v2WLCPD13b, attribute field tgcontour; (5) drainage enforcement off; (6) tolerances set to 0 for accuracy and density of the elevation points, 1 for horizontal standard error, and 0 for vertical standard error; and (7) 30 iterations. The output TOPOGRID raster was titled h_ga01a_pd13.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>The revised raster of water-level change from predevelopment to 2013 was modified further using the Esri Arc/Info Version 10.0 commands SETNULL and CON with applicable rasters to identify the cells to be changed. The SETNULL and CON commands were applied using the following rasters 
				(1) raster g02_aqisle to change the cell values to missing data in areas where the aquifer is not present (Gutentag and others, 1984; Qi, 2010); 
				(2) rasters r1_pd13max and r2_pd13min to examine the absolute value of each cell within the polygons of water-level change to reassign the cell's value, if appropriate, to either the lower value of the corresponding range (as absolute values) for the polygon, if the cell value was less than the polygons lower value, or to the higher value of the corresponding range (as absolute values) for the polygon, if the cell value was greater than the polygons higher value; 
				(3) raster h_ldpd13_g to change the cell values to 10.01 in the areas of rises in Central Platte River Valley in Nebraska(Luckey and others, 1981; Gutentag and others, 1984); 
				(4) raster h_nscpd13_g to change the cell values to zero in the areas with water-level change between a decline of 5 ft and a rise of 5 ft, because of uncertainty in interpolating relatively small water-level changes especially in areas where there are few wells measured in both predevelopment and 2013; and 
				(5) raster gnosatpoly09 to change the cell values to missing data in the areas of little or no saturated thickness (Gutentag and others, 1984; Cederstrand and Becker, 1999a).
				The resultant raster with areas of no substantial change set to zero was titled h_ga01d_pd13. The resultant raster with areas of little or no saturated thickness set to null was titled h_ga01e_pd13.

      <overview>
         <eaover>This floating-point raster dataset represent water-level change in the High Plains aquifer from predevelopment to 2013, in ft. The maximum and minimum value of the raster is -255.96 ft to 82.53 ft. The measured values for water-level changes, predevelopment to 2013, ranged from a decline of 256 ft for a well in Texas to a rise of 85 ft for a well in Nebraska. The interpolation process used to generate the rasters referred to in this report results in cell values, for cells collocated with a measured well, that are generally similar to, but commonly not exactly equal to, the corresponding values based on those water-level measurements. The cell values represent the value for an area 500 meters by 500 meters and the measured values are point values within the area represented by the cell.
