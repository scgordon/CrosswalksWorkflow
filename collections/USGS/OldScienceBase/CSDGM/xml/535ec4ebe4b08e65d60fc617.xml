         <abstract>
A Tortugas/Florida Bay pink shrimp simulation model has been identified as a priority need in CERP by the South Florida Water Management District, NOAA, NPS and USGS.  This model has been under development through the collaboration of a team of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), USGS and University of Miami (UM) researchers since 1997.  The purpose of the model is to assist in designing and refining restoration alternatives by predicting their impact on production of pink shrimp in Florida Bay and on shrimp recruitment from Florida Bay to the Tortugas fishery.

The data collected from six sites include salinity, temperature, and water level for all stations.  In addition discharge and tidal discharge were collected for four of the sites.  Data were collected from 2001 to 2004.

         <purpose>
Florida Bay lies downstream of the Everglades ecosystem.  Perceived deterioration of the Everglades over the last century - and Florida Bay since the mid-1980&#x92;s - is generally viewed as linked to changes in freshwater flow and water quality associated with water management in South Florida.  A pink shrimp simulation model is being developed to assist in designing and refining restoration alternatives by predicting their impact on production of pink shrimp in Florida Bay and on shrimp recruitment from Florida Bay to the Tortugas fishery.

The pink shrimp is a good indicator of the health and productivity of the Bay.  The effect of salinity and temperature on pink shrimp growth and survivorship and of habitat on juvenile density provide a basis for predicting the abundance of pink shrimp juveniles in Florida Bay and thus the magnitude of recruitment to the Tortugas fishery. A landscape model is needed to express pink shrimp performance measures as functions of spatially complex factors acting across the Bay.  Florida Bay is a complex shallow water ecosystem with distinct zones of different physical and biological characteristics (Fourqurean and Robblee 1999) that differ in their potential to support pink shrimp.  The influence of upstream water management on pink shrimp recruitment from Florida Bay is expected to express itself principally through changes in salinity and seagrass habitat associated with changes in freshwater inflow.  Predictions of the effect of these changes on the Bay&#x92;s productive capacity require consideration not only of the resulting salinity and seagrass changes but also the resulting change in the area of overlap of these factors favorable to the pink shrimp (Browder and Moore 1981; Browder 1991).

In October of 2001, a study began to determine the volume transport at each of the six stations where postlarvae are being sampled.  Acoustic Doppler technology was been installed at the four defined channels connecting Florida Bay with the Gulf of Mexico (Sandy, Middle Ground) and the Atlantic Ocean (Whale Harbor, Indian Key) and the two interior channels Conchie, Panhandle) that connect to Florida Bay interior sub basins where monthly postlarval sampling occurs.

Field data collection of water level, temperature, salinity, and discharge:

Data collected at instrumented sites included continuous (15-minute or hourly) measurements of water level, water velocity, salinity/specific conductance, temperature, and periodic measurements of discharge for index velocity calibrations. More information on index velocity techniques is discussed in Hittle and others (2001) and Morlock and others (2002), and Ruhl and others (2005).  Non-transmitting sites are routinely serviced and field data is manually uploaded to the USGS database.

Boat mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP) were used to measure discharge at the estuarine monitoring stations. The ADCP uses the Doppler shift in returned acoustic signals reflected by particles suspended in the water to determine the velocity of moving water (Simpson 2002 and Oberg and others 2005). The ADCP also has the capability to measure water depth, flow direction, and speed of the boat based on acoustic reflections from the streambed. Discharge and flow direction were both calculated from information provided by the ADCP and computer software. The mean water velocity was calculated by dividing the total measured discharge by the cross-sectional area corresponding to the water level at the time of measurement (Sauer 2002 and Ruhl and others 2005).

Acoustic velocity meter (AVM) and acoustic Doppler velocity meter (ADVM) systems were used to measure continuous water velocity. The velocity measured by the ADVM systems represents an "index" of the mean water velocity. The index velocity is a measured velocity at the instrumented sites that can be used to compute the mean channel velocity.

A boat-mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used to calculate total discharge along a transect of the channels during inspections.  The ADCP also measured water depth, boat speed, and direction of boat movement using acoustic reflections from the streambed.  Discharge and flow direction were both calculated from data collected with the ADCP.  The mean velocity for the creek section was calculated by dividing the total discharge measured with the ADCP by the cross-sectional area corresponding to the water level at the time of the discharge measurement.  The cross-sectional area was computed by using site-specific stage-area ratings.  A velocity rating between the mean ADCP velocity and the in situ ADVM velocity was calculated by regression analysis.  This rating equation was then used to calculate continous discharge using the velocity data.

Water level data were used to determine water depth and to calculate the stage-dependent cross-sectional area.  Water level data were collected an incremental shaft encoder equipped with a pulley, stainless-steel tape, weight, and float inside an 8 in. polyvinyl chloride pipe stilling well (Sauer 2002), pressure sensors, or acoustic transducers. Corrections to water level data followed USGS quality assurance quality control protocols (Rantz and others 1982 and Sauer 2002).

Salinity was measured near mid-depth help determine the presence of freshwater flow and to examine potential effects on the acoustic signals caused by salinity stratification. Continuous salinity measurements are important for describing the seasonal patterns of freshwater flow (wet/dry season) and for identifying bi-directional flow. Elevations of the continuous monitors are available upon request. Temperature was measured to monitor possible vertical gradients that also could affect acoustic signals. Due to biological fouling and electronic drift, the continuous monitor requires routine cleaning and calibration to maintain data quality. During the period of record, continuous monitors were calibrated during site visits to ambient conditions using a reference probe (USGS National Field Manual). Ambient salinity conditions were measured with a portable reference probe that was calibrated and or verified against a range of laboratory specific conductance standards. Reference temperature probes are verified against a NIST thermometer prior to field trips. When in situ temperature measurements differed by more than 0.2 deg. C when compared to the reference temperature probe, the in situ probe was replaced.
