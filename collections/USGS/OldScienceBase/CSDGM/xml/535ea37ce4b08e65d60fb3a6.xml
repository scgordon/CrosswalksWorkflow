         <abstract>The Sprague River drains 4090 square kilometers in south-central Oregon before flowing into the Williamson River and upper Klamath Lake. In cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USGS and University of Oregon conducted a study to evaluate channel and floodplain processes for the 131 km of the Sprague River and its major tributaries, including the lower 20 km of the South Fork Sprague River, the lower 16 km of the North Fork Sprague River, and the lower 62 km of the Sycan River. The study involved multiple analyses, including assessments of historical channel change, riparian and floodplain vegetation, and surficial geology. To support these analyses, digital floodplain and channel maps were prepared from historic notes, maps, and aerial photos to depict channel and floodplain conditions at different times between 1866 and 2005. The geospatial database of current and historic channel and floodplain conditions will also enable evaluation of long-term trends pertaining to aquatic and riparian habitat conditions.</abstract>
         <purpose>These data were created to support understanding of geomorphic conditions and historical changes to channel and floodplain conditions for the Sprague River and the lower portions of its major tributaries. GIS layers depicting channel centerlines, water features, fluvial bars, floodplain vegetation, and floodplain features such as irrigation canals, levees and dikes, and roads were created from aerial photographs dating from 1940, 1968, and 2000. The purpose of this mapping was to track changes in channel and floodplain morphology and vegetation over time and to measure changes in channel position. Historical aerial photographs from 1940 and 1968 were acquired, scanned, and rectified for this project, while digital orthophotographs from 2000 are publicly available. (See metadata for each photograph set for more information on the rectification process and resolution of each dataset). In addition, channel centerlines were mapped from publicly available coverages for 1975 (Natural Resources Conservation Service Soil Survey of Klamath County) and 2005 (U.S. Department of Agriculture NAIP imagery). The surficial geologic mapping was done to support understanding of the geologic context of the modern floodplain, and encompasses the alluvial valleys of the Sprague River and the lower portions of the Sycan, North Fork, and South Fork Sprague Rivers.</purpose>

         <attraccr>Image evaluation and feature interpretation occurred at a scale of 1:10,000 - 1:500.  Digitization of features occurred at a scale of 1:1,000.</attraccr>

      <logic>Topology rules were used to clean and edit features digitized within the floodplain boundary data set for overlap and boundary accuracy.  A separate topology was run to edit digitizing overlap with the floodplain boundary data set and the features digitized within it to ensure all features were enclosed within the final floodplain boundary.</logic>
      <complete>Data are complete. Digitization of features occurred at a scale of 1:1000.  In general, all features that were clearly visible at that scale were digitized.  Minimum size and density specifications for digitizing are listed in each attribute definition. Where vegetation overhang and shadows overlapped with other features within the floodplain boundary digitizing an accurate boundary of the covered feature was attempted.  Interpreting the boundary of the covered feature (Water, Built Feature or Bar) was done by extrapolating edges from visible data. Varied discharge associated with different photo dates occasionally resulted in discontinuity of water features at photo overlap and boundaries.  In the situation of discontinuity at overlap one photo was exchanged for a bordering photo at approximately the mid-point of overlap and features were digitized to the photo being utilized. When discontinuity occurred at image boundaries or the photo exchange point the water feature with the greatest area was digitized. Mean daily discharges associated with different photo dates are recorded in the Photo Sets and Related Stream Discharge.xls spreadsheet located inside the SpragueRiverAnalysis.mdb file. Vegetation is defined as land cover classification on all terrestrial surfaces within the floodplain boundary.  In digitizing vegetation from the 2000 photo set, ground truthing information collected the summer of 2007 was used to verify a portion of tall woody species locations and relative distributions.  Ground truthing photos and notes were also used to validate distinctions between short homogeneous short woody patches vs. herbaceous patches.  2005 color aerial photographs (NAIP, 2005) were also used as cross reference.  The photo set for 1968 posed some interpretation challenges as some of the photos were taken in early spring prior to leaf out of both short and tall deciduous species.  Identification of aspen stands required use of alternate characteristics such as thin linear shadows and round, gray crown tops for mapping, along with considerable cross referencing of 2000 and 1940s photos for general locations. Short woody species in the upper basin (upstream of Kamkaun Springs reach) were often still bare, but were recognizable with stem structure and reliance on other photo sets for location.  Photos from the 1940s set were of lower quality and required greater dependence on color than texture for tall vs. short woody classification, and texture more than color for differentiation between woody vegetation and water.  Some patches of vegetation exhibited characteristics of both tall woody and short woody features, required the use of species habitat preferences for classification.  Aspen were rarely found immediately next to water features, and occupy only certain reaches of the river.  Ponderosa pines were found mostly in the canyon sections and at the far margins of the floodplains.  Short woody plants were found in combination with tall woody species in all reaches, appearing in wide valley sections at nearly any distance from the main channel or secondary water features.</complete>

            <procdesc>Digitizing:  Began digitizing channel and floodplain features and river centerlines for 2000. Completed in 2008.  Digitizing Protocol: The Sprague River Project is focused on geomorphic and vegetation changes over time within the active geomorphic floodplain of the Sprague River watershed. We defined the active geomorphic floodplain as the area adjacent to the channel system that is low-lying and displays geomorphic features typical of channel erosion and depositional processes clearly on imagery, including aerial photos, 7.5 min USGS topo maps, and LIDAR images (Watershed Sciences, 2005).  Geomorphic features used to define the extent of the active geomorphic floodplain included point bars, scroll bars, abandoned channels (including oxbows ponds and filled channels), and swell and swale topography.  The active geomorphic floodplain was distinguished from adjacent alluvial surfaces that are smoother and show less evidence of erosion and deposition, although some of these adjacent surfaces may be flooded regularly by overbank flows. Digital data sets were first digitized from the 2000 DOQs.  High resolution LiDAR imagery data (Watershed Sciences, 2005) was used to identify topographic details that assisted in feature classification.  If the feature visible in the LiDAR was not visible in the 2000 DOQ the feature was not digitized.  Additional comparison with the 1998 color air photo mosaic (USFWS 1998) aided in evaluating the 2000 DOQs. The 2000 digital data was then used as a template for digitizing features from the 1968 and 1940s photo sets.  Because the spatial context of this project is focused within the active geomorphic floodplain, interpreting and digitizing the floodplain boundary was prioritized to define area of digitization in all three year sets. Original data sets were digitized in ArcMap as separate shapefiles (line or polygon).  Line files were "buffered" in ArcMAP to generate polygons with a calculable area for these features. All digitizing was reviewed and edited by the graduate research assistants or project leaders for interpretation consistency and data accuracy.  After editing, the shapefiles were input into a geodatabase.  The geodatabase was used to organize the data sets by data type and subtype, feature prioritization, and topology rules.</procdesc>

                  <edomvd>All primarily non-vegetated terrestrial surfaces within the floodplain boundary.  Bare features were identified by a very light tone that results in a whiteness of coloration relative to adjacent surfaces, and typically had a smooth and uniform texture.  All road, bridge, building, railroad, and bar features were also classified as Bare, as well as scoured or disturbed features on the floodplain.  Bars and Built Features classified as Bare are identified in Notes field of the attribute table for year sets 1940s, 1968, and 2000.</edomvd>

                  <edomvd>A minimum of 5 distinct trees or shrubs, and plants must be no more than 20 pixels (20 meters) distance from each other to be considered a grouping for digitization as a polygon. Short woody species are those less than 6 meters tall. Height distinctions were made on visual interpretation.  Actual height of plants initially used to distinguish classification for 2000 air photo set off of LiDAR imagery when visual identification was difficult (shrub (short woody) 1.5-3 meters).  A slightly lighter tone than the darker tone of tall woody was classified as short woody vegetation. Individual plants with a relatively smaller foliage diameter area were classified as short woody vegetation.</edomvd>

                  <edomvd>A minimum of 5 distinct trees or shrubs, and plants must be no more than 20 pixels (20 meters) distance from each other to be considered a grouping for digitization as a polygon.  Tall woody species are those judged to be greater than approximately 6 meters tall.  Height distinctions were made on visual interpretation.  Actual height of plants initially used to distinguish classification for 2000 air photo set off of LiDAR imagery when visual identification was difficult (trees (tall woody) &gt; 3 meters).  A darker tone was used to identify tall woody vegetation where visible shadows were lacking, usually due to proximity of individual plants to each other.  The darker tone depicts a roughness difference between canopy vegetation and herbaceous coverage and also reflects a typically darker green color of aspen and ponderosa pine.  Isolated patches of darker toned vegetation was more likely to have shadows. Individual plants with a larger diameter foliage cover were classified as tall woody vegetation.</edomvd>
