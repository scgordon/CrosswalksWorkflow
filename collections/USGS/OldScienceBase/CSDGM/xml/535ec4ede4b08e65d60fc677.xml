         <abstract>
In 1996, the U.S. Geological Survey began a 4-year study of the flow and nutrient characteristics of three major streams that drain parts of the Everglades National Park.  An upward looking acoustic Doppler current profiler, a water-level sensor, and two specific conductance sensors were installed at each site.  Monthly discharge measurements are made with an acoustic Doppler current profiler to develop discharge ratings.

Data collected at the Broad River, Harney River, and Shark River stations include water level, water velocity, specific conductance and temperature, total and dissolved phosphorus species, pH, and dissolved oxygen.  These three stations were established in 1997.

         <purpose>
The southwest coast of Florida is part of a wilderness area with unique hydraulic characteristics that has historically been described as the "River of Grass".  Flat terrain and lack of controlled topographic information has made it difficult to define drainage divides.  Low gradients, coupled with tidal effects, create complex conditions under which to measure river flow.  It has been almost thirty years since any effort has been made to monitor flow characteristics continuously in the area.  Significant technological advancements have occurred during this time and this new technology can be applied to help obtain the information needed to make informed decisions about the future of this unique coastal area.

Flow, nutrient concentrations, and nutrient load data will provide part of the basic information needed to understand the hydrologic and water-quality characteristics for a part of the southwest coast of Florida. The analysis of these measurements will help characterize the current conditions for the three sites and explain the relation between upgradient water levels and southwest coastal stream flows, and the possible interaction between southwest coastal waters and the waters of Florida Bay.  The data can also be used as input to hydrodynamic and water-quality models.

The Broad, Harney, and Shark River monitoring station locations were selected based on an initial reconnaissance of the study area in June 1996 that included bathymetry, hydrodynamic characteristics, and water-quality. Aerial photography also was used to locate the monitoring stations. These three stations were established between November 1996 and January 1997. A second field reconnaissance conducted in December 1997, and a meeting with ENP personnel in October 1998, were used to locate two additional discharge and nutrient flux monitoring stations. Station installations at Lostmans Creek and North River were completed in April 1999.

Continuous monitoring of water-level, stream velocity, and specific conductance combined with periodic discharge measurements and collection of water-quality samples were required to compute the discharge and nutrient flux from the five estuarine river stations. Stream velocity (index-velocity) data were used to estimate the mean cross-section channel velocity (mean velocity) that was measured using a vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler discharge measurement system. Stream velocity data were used with the measured mean channel velocity to develop index-to-mean velocity relations. Each station was equipped with similar instrumentation. Data collected at each station were reviewed for accuracy and entered into the USGS NWIS database. Data for each station were then used to develop regression equations that were used to estimate water discharge and nutrient flux.

Water-Level and Velocity Measurements
Water level was measured at each station using Design Analysis Associates H-310 vented-submersible pressure sensors that were mounted within 2-in. inside-diameter polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipes with end caps, which functioned as stilling wells. Quarter-inch holes were drilled around the perimeter of the PVC pipe within 6 in. of the bottom. Pressure sensors were programmed to average over an 8-second period every 15 minutes. Distances to water-level surfaces were measured from fixed reference points every 4 to 6 weeks and compared to the water levels measured by the pressure transducers. Water-surface reference measurements varied less than 0.02 ft from the pressure transducer water levels during the study.

Two types of vertically oriented acoustic Doppler velocity systems were used to measure 2-min averages of velocity through the water column every 15 minutes:

(1) SonTek ADP 1.5 and 3 MHz velocity profilers, and
(2) SonTek Argonaut-XR 3 MHz depth-averaging velocity sensors.

Vertically oriented velocity profilers were used because vertical stratification of flow was possible, and because these sensors allow variations in the velocity profiles in the water column to be measured during all conditions.   One drawback to using a vertically oriented index-velocity system is the limited amount of across-channel volume that is measured. In rivers and streams with variable cross-channel flow distribution, this could prove to be a problem. If water flow is relatively uniform and flow patterns are always the same across the channel, vertically oriented sensors can provide an alternative to horizontally oriented index-velocity systems.

Discharge Measurements
River discharge was measured directly using a vessel-mounted acoustic discharge system (Simpson and Oltmann, 1992). An RD Instruments 1.2 MHz acoustic Doppler discharge measurement system was used to measure discharge for calibration and validation of the index-to-mean velocity relation at all stations every 4 to 6 weeks. The discharge section edges were marked with buoys and unmeasured edge section distances were measured using optical and laser range finders. Discharge values were calculated using manufacturer's software. Individual discharge measurements took between 4 to 10 minutes to complete.

Discharge measurements were collected over varying ranges of tidal level and tidal phase for about one year to develop an index-to-mean velocity relation for each station. Multiple measurements were made during 3- to 6-hour periods to better characterize variations in flow caused by variations in tide, inflow, and wind effects, and to reduce serial correlations between measurement sets. Discharge data collected after the calibration period were used to check the accuracy of the water-level/velocity/discharge relations for the duration of the study and to apply corrections or shifts to the index-to-mean velocity relations if required. Corrections to the velocity regressions were not required at four of the five stations during the study. The Harney River station index-velocity data were corrected for June 1998 because of an electronics problem that caused the index-velocity data to be biased low.
