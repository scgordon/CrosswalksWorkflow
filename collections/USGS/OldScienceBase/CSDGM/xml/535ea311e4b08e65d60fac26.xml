         <supplinf>Introduction --

This data set consists of digital polygons of a constant
hydraulic conductivity value for the alluvial and terrace
deposits along the North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to
Eufaula Lake in east-central Oklahoma. Ground water in 710
square miles of Quaternary-age alluvial and terrace deposits
along the North Canadian River is an important source of water
for irrigation, industrial, municipal, stock, and domestic
supplies. The aquifer, composed of alluvial and terrace
deposits, consists of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. The aquifer
is underlain and in hydraulic connection with the upper zone of
the Permian-age Garber-Wellington aquifer and the
Pennsylvanian-age Ada-Vamoosa aquifer. Other Permian and
Pennsylvanian-age rocks underlying the alluvial and terrace
deposits have low permeabilities and are not in hydraulic
connection with the alluvial and terrace aquifer (Havens, 1989).

The constant hydraulic conductivity value and some of the
polygon boundaries are from a ground-water modeling report
published by the U.S. Geological Survey entitled,
"Geohydrology of the alluvial and terrace deposits of the
North Canadian River from Oklahoma City to Eufaula Lake,
central Oklahoma," by Havens (1989, p. 22 and pl. 6). Other
polygon boundaries were extracted from digital surficial
geology data sets by Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b) based on a
scale of 1:250,000 and digitized from a paper-base map by
Havens (1989, plate 6), also at a scale of 1:250,000.

Hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was estimated to be 310
feet per day by Havens (1989, p. 22) and was assumed to be
uniform throughout the aquifer. Digital Line Graph (DLG) format
requires numbers to be stored as integers. Therefore, the
hydraulic conductivity in feet per day was multiplied by 10 and
stored in the digital data sets as tenths of a foot per day. For
example 310 feet per day was multiplied by 10 and stored in the
digital data sets as 3100 tenths of a foot per day. Permian
outcrops and parts of the aquifer that were not included in the
ground-water model were given a value -99999 to indicate the
hydraulic conductivity is not known.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in
balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the
natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly
known, then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model
and presented in this data set are not precise, but are within
a reasonable range when compared to independently collected
data. In most aquifers, hydraulic conductivity measurements
made in wells or in cores will range over several orders of
magnitude, even over short horizontal and vertical distances.
Hydraulic conductivity values derived from ground-water flow
models represent areal generalizations and do not reflect the
large local variance in well or core measurements.

Reviews Applied to Data --

This electronic report was subjected to the same review standard
that applies to all U.S. Geological Survey reports. Reviewers
were asked to check the topological consistency, tolerances,
attribute frequencies and statistics, projection, and geographic
extent. Reviewers were given digital data sets and paper plots
for checking against the source maps to verify the linework and
attributes. The reviewers checked the metadata and a_readme.1st
files for completeness and accuracy.

Related Spatial and Tabular Data Sets --

This data set is one of four digital map data sets being published
together for this aquifer. The four data sets are:

&gt;              aqbound -  aquifer boundaries

&gt;              cond    -  hydraulic conductivity

&gt;              recharg -  aquifer recharge

&gt;              wlelev  -  water-level elevation contours

Digital map data sets of the Oklahoma surficial geology digitized from
1:250,000-scale maps (or 1:125,000-scale maps for the three Oklahoma
panhandle counties) are published separately.

      <useconst>Lines representing aquifer boundaries, and therefore hydraulic
conductivity boundaries, were extracted from digital geology
data sets by Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b) based on a scale of
1:250,000. Some of the model-grid boundaries (Havens, 1989,
plate 6) were digitized from a paper-base map with a maximum
registration root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0135 map
inches (0.0053 map centimeters). Hydraulic conductivity
polygons represented at this scale are indicative of broad,
regional trends and should not be interpreted as
site-specific.

Ground-water flow models are numerical representations that
simplify and aggregate natural systems. Models are not unique;
different combinations of aquifer characteristics may produce
similar results. The hydraulic conductivity and recharge are
closely interrelated. As long as these two model inputs are in
balance the model has a small mean residual; it represents the
natural system numerically. If the hydraulic conductivity is
accurately known, the model can be used to accurately determine
recharge. Likewise, if the hydraulic conductivity is poorly known,
then the recharge will be poorly determined.

Therefore, values of hydraulic conductivity used in the model

a reasonable range when compared to independently collected

      <overview>
         <eaover>Each polygon in this data set has an associated attribute, K,
containing a hydraulic conductivity value (Havens, 1989)
expressed in tenths of a foot per day. The hydraulic
conductivity of 310 feet per day is stored as a K value of
3100 tenths of a foot per day. Polygons in this data set that
contain a K value of -99999 represent areas where the
hydraulic conductivity value is not known. K is stored in the
first major code (MAJOR1) and 0 is stored in the first minor
code (MINOR1) for polygons in the Digital Line Graph (DLG)
version of this data set.

Each line in this digital data set has an associated
attribute, LSOURCE, that contains a code to indicate the line
source. A LSOURCE code of 1 indicates the line is from Havens
(1989) and an LSOURCE code of 2 indicates the line was
extracted from Cederstrand (1996a, 1996b). LSOURCE is stored
in the first major code (MAJOR1) for lines, and 0 is stored in
the first minor code (MINOR1) in the DLG version of this data
set.
