      <abstract>This dataset reports measurements of plant available nutrients made using&amp;#xD;
Plant Root Simulator (PRS) probes (Western Ag Innovations Inc.) during&amp;#xD;
2012 and 2013 at the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE)&amp;#xD;
Arctic field site near Barrow, Alaska. In 2012, Ca, Mg, K, P, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, S, Pb, Al, Cd, NO3-N and NH4-N availability were measured during spring, summer and winter from probes installed in the centers, edges and troughs of four polygons in each of four areas of contrasting moisture regime and polygon type (Areas A, B, C, and D of Intensive Site 1). In 2013, probes were installed in centers, edges and troughs of four polygons in each of two areas (A and B, with low-centered and high-centered polygons respectively) at two-week intervals and at 3 soil depths to capture fine-scale seasonal dynamics of NO3-N and NH4-N.&amp;#xD;
PRS probes are ion exchange resin membranes held in plastic supports that are inserted into soil to measure ion supply in situ. The anion and cation exchange with the membrane is intended to mimic plant uptake and thus provide a relevant measure of soil nutrient bioavailability. Measurements are made per area of probe membrane and cannot be converted to concentrations or related to soil volume. doi:10.5440/1120920, http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1120920</abstract>
      <purpose>Data were collected to characterize seasonal and depth dynamics of plant nutrient availability across geomorphic units in a polygonal tundra landscape, in accordance with Vegetation Dynamics Task V3.2.</purpose>

        <methdesc>In 2012, 4 pairs (1 anion, 1 cation) of probes were installed at a single depth of 0 - 5.5 cm close to 48, 1 x 1 m plots located in center, edge and trough positions in 4 replicate polygons (1-4) in each of 4 study areas representing different polygon types (A,B,C,D). Availability of Ca, Mg, K, P, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, S, Pb, Al, Cd, NO3-N and NH4-N were measured from 23rd June - 27th July,  27th July - 28th August and 28th August - 18th June 2013. &amp;#xD;
&amp;#xD;
In 2013, probes were installed only in 2 study areas (A, B), and measurements made during six 14 day intervals between 18th June and 13th September. For the first two time intervals, probes were installed at 0 - 5.5 cm, for the third and fourth interval, at both 0 - 5.5 and 11 - 16.5 cm, and for the final two intervals, at 0 - 5.5 cm, 11 - 16.5 cm and 22 - 27.5 cm depth.&amp;#xD;
&amp;#xD;
Probes were installed and analyzed according to the Plant Root Simulator Operations Manual (Western Ag Innovations Inc., Saskatoon, Canada); details specific to this study are provided in the User File.</methdesc>
