  <dcterms:title>Data from: On the Helmert-blocking Technique: its acceleration by Block Choleski decomposition and formulae to insert observations into an adjusted network</dcterms:title>
  <dcterms:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t23n3</dcterms:identifier>
  <dcterms:description>The Helmert-blocking (HB) technique is a common approach to adjust large geodetic networks like Europeans and Brazilians. The technique is based upon a division of the network into partial networks called blocks. This way, the global network adjustment can be done by manipulating these blocks. Here we show alternatives to solve the block system that arises from the application of the technique. We show an alternative that optimizes its implementation as the elapsed processing time is decreased by about 33%. We also show that to insert observations into an adjusted network it is not necessary to readjust the whole network. We show the formulae to insert new observations into an adjusted network that are more efficient than simply readjusting the whole new network.</dcterms:description>
