This assessment of carbon dynamics in Alaska includes (1) syntheses of soil, vegetation, and surface water carbon stocks and fluxes in Alaska, and (2) state of the art models of fire dynamics, vegetation change, forest management, permafrost dynamics, and upland, wetland, and surface water ecosystem carbon dynamics.  Here we report on progress in the soils synthesis, fire and vegetation dynamics synthesis, and syntheses of upland, wetland, and inland waters components.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:spatial xsi:type="dcterms:Box">northlimit=75; southlimit=50; eastlimit=-130; westlimit=-180</dcterms:spatial></onedcx:dcTerms></onedcx:metadata>
