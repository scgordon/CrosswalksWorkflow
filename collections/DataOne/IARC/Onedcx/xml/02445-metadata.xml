These systems often loiter,
generating moderate to severe marine states which can exhibit persistence, maximizing
damage and hazard potential. This analysis presents the wave states associated with selected
storms over the Bering and Chukchi Seas. These include the damaging events of October
2004, September 2005, and November 2009, along with a strong event from September 2011
that exhibited north winds. For each event a brief synoptic overview is presented followed by
consideration of the resultant wave state, including parameters such as wave steepness. Wave
data come from NOAA&#8217;s WAVEWATCH III operational global ocean wave model, implemented
locally on the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center at University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Comparison with observational data gathered by a wave buoy, funded by the US Environmental
Protection Agency/NOAA and deployed in 2011, is also undertaken.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:spatial xsi:type="dcterms:Box">northlimit=76.9921875; southlimit=45.17578125; eastlimit=-122.16796875; westlimit=-180</dcterms:spatial><dcterms:temporal>Begin 2004-10-18T13:55:00; End 2011-09-09T13:55:00</dcterms:temporal></onedcx:dcTerms></onedcx:metadata>
